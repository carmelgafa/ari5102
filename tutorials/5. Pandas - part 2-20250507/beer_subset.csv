7.0,2511,287,Bell's Cherry Stout,American Stout,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,blaheath,4.5," Batch 8144	Pitch black in color with a 1/2 finger head. Aroma is of dark fruits, chocolate, and roasted malts. Taste is dominated by tart cherry with a light acidity plus chocolate/roasted malt and coffee. Medium mouthfeel and a short sweet finish. At two years old, I think that this still has the staying power for a few years to come. I can't wait to find out.",2009-10-05 21:31:48
5.7,19736,9790,Duck-Rabbit Porter,American Porter,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,GJ40,4.0," Sampled from a 12oz bottle in a standard pint glass starting at 48 degrees. Bottle says enjoy by 11/09.		Pours a deep dark brown with a hint of light coming through. Based on what does come through, it seems to have good clarity. The thick beige head settles quickly into a smaller but more durable covering. The aroma has hints of toast, raisins, chocolate and coffee. The flavor is complex with a balanced mix of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee with a hint of fruit. The consistency is very creamy with a nice low carbonation.		This is a tasty beer that I plan to have more regularly.",2009-10-05 21:32:09
4.8,11098,3182,FÃ¼rstenberg Premium Pilsener,German Pilsener,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,biegaman,3.5," Haystack yellow with an energetic group of bubbles that unremittingly shoot their way up to the surface. Complexion is clean, clarity is good - so far so great. Last on the checklist: a pillowy white head. Or nearly one; this capping isn't ideal but, overlooking a few thin spots, it suffices. Frstenberg scores well on the pilsner appearance test. 		Premium Pilsner is suppose to be ""pleasantly hoppy"". I think the brewery needs a proof-reader for their write-ups; this is (un)pleasantly (un)hoppy. Bread, crackers and a tinge of corn don't come close to the zesty, earthy, pungent and floral hoppiness that is typical of great pilsners. It's clean enough but a pilsner not reeking of hops is not a pilsner at all. 		That said, it does taste a little like them. Only a little, mind you, but significantly more than most large-scale German lagers that make their way over the pond. Still, crackers and white bread dominate and green, spicy cones are basically an afterthought. The beer is rather lean, a little more maltiness would have likely made up for that fact.		I notice the can doesn't mention anything about the German purity law. Curious. The shelf life is alarming. There is some taste of adjuncts, less noted than in most imports but definitely more noted than in most pilsners. Again, hop bitterness is missed. Is this refreshing and quaffable? Sure. But colder temperatures definitely work in its favor. 		The brewery insists: ""this is how one of the best beers in the world should taste!"" What to say to that? One of? What about the others? At least in so far as pilsners go this isn't too far from what the world's best should taste like... but it's not exactly that close either. I insist: ""this is what one of the world's most run-of-the-mill beers should taste like!""",2009-10-05 21:32:13
9.5,28577,3818,Unearthly (Imperial India Pale Ale),American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,nick76,4.0," The aroma has pine, wood, citrus, caramel, and incense. The appearance is hazy amber with a foamy head. The flavor is like the aroma with a robust hop character as well as plenty of sweet malt to balance. The palate is smooth and full. Overall this is a rich beer despite not being super complex.",2009-10-05 21:32:37
5.8,398,119,Wolaver's Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,champ103,3.0," A: Pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color. A two finger white head forms and leaves some sticky lace behind.	S: A very subtle aroma. Oily, soapy, and floral hops. Some sweetness. A mineral aroma as well. Also some perfume? This is a little odd.	T: Similar to the nose. Floral and grassy hops. Sweet caramel malt. Soap, and a mineral flavor.	M/D: A medium body and carbonation. Pretty easy to drink. An easy choice for a session beer.		This is a good beer. Not my favorite from the brewery, but worth a try.",2009-10-05 21:33:14
7.0,966,365,Pike Street XXXXX Stout,American Stout,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,sprucetip,4.5," From notes. Pours black, thin mocha head fades fast, plenty of lacing. SMELL is roasted barley, black patent, some sweetness, hint of heat. TASTE is roasty flavors up front, some sweetness from the malty base through the middle, then roasty and hoppy bitterness emerging for the finish. Coffee, chocolate and alchohol flavors add some complexity. FEEL is thick,full, rich and chewy. Some bitternes in the finish. OVERALL easy enough to drink for a full bodied, hopped up west coast stout. Flavor is bold for a moderately sized brew.",2009-10-05 21:33:48
6.2,53128,1114,Smokin' Amber Kegs Gone Wild,American Amber / Red Ale,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,Deuane,4.5," An American amber with the addition of smoked malt then aged with an addition of brett---&gt;WTF?!		A-Deep copper with a thin tan head that reduced to a thin veil and left spotty lace.		S-Smoky and tart, very interesting. Like a smoked sausage with sauerkraut!		T-Tart zing up front with a light, smoky smoothness underneath. Smooth, with a wonderful, complex melding of flavours		M-Medium-light body, very complex with nice lingering flavours. A dry, cabernet sauvignon type finish.		D-So complex, interesting and odd it works! Awesome stuff. Sometimes the craziest things work....this one sure did!",2009-10-05 21:34:24
4.8,1669,256,Great White,Witbier,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,n0rc41,4.5," Ok, for starters great white I believe will be in my top 3 all time favorites! I have been drinking great white for many years now. I have drank it in the cafe in eureka, bars in my home town, bottles in my garage. 		Appearance is great, nice yellow with a smooth head that goes down fast.		Smells of citrus nicely but not too overwhelming.		the taste was great! i loved it from the start, the citrus is great flavor but not over whelming. went down very smooth with not too long lasting alcohol taste. 		I would give this a better drinkability review do to the fact that i cant ever just have one of these. working in my garage I found myself drinking alot more of them then I should. Great white goes awesome with spicy foods! I believe great white is the pringles of beers. once you pop you cant stop! great beer!",2009-10-05 21:34:29
6.7,6549,140,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop Ale,American IPA,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,david18,4.0," I like all of Sierra Nevada's beers but felt that they had not offered a great, highly hoppy beer that i've been crazy about. The pale ale is great and I love the stout and porter but their ipas have not been great. 		This one, however, is very good and has a perfect balance of hops and malt. Darker than most ipas it has a great brown/copper color, intense hop flavor, good carbonation and intense aroma.		Very good.",2009-10-05 21:34:31
6.5,13824,743,Oktoberfest,Vienna Lager,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,Seanibus,2.5," This actually winds up coming out like a light pumpkin beer, although I see no evidence they were actually aiming for that. 		Pours clear copper with fizzy carbonation, though the head collapses with dismaying rapidity. The aroma is strong at first - honeyish and spicy, though it fades incredibly fast, leaving only the slightest whiff of malt. The flavor is a bit better, round with some clove and cinnamon coming from the malt. The finish, however, is a bit bitter and sour. The mouthfeel has some of the creaminess one gets in a pumpkin beer.		This one doesn't do it for me - it doesn't have any of the crisp snap of a well-executed Oktoberfest. It feels flabby and round and the satisfying malt burn turns quickly into a sour aftertaste.",2009-10-05 21:35:09
11.8,43670,423,Bourbon Barrel Quad (BBQ),Quadrupel (Quad),4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,blaheath,4.5," Burnt amber in color with a 1/4"" head. Aroma is dominated by oak, followed by cherries, vanilla and bourbon. Taste is medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation, heavy new oak, vanilla, cherry, cigar, mint, noticeable alcohol, and a semi-sweet/dry finish. Recommended.",2009-10-05 21:36:03
6.3,53129,14365,Seneca Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),3.0,3.5,4.5,4.0,Daniellobo,4.0," A very pleasing PA leaning strongly on the IPA side. 		Presentation: 16 Oz. draft offering on the brew pub. Menu offers a short description about a balanced brew, warning that this assertively hoppy brew is a bit more bitter and aromatic than an American style ale. Alc. by Vol. noted at 6.3%. Served in a pint shaker glass. 		A - Medium amber color with a shy touch of foam (Another pint that has been served almost filled up to the rim...) Good lacing over a foamy layer and ring. 		S - Resiny feel and citrus freshness. 		T - It's a differing kind of balance, nice hop resins, grapefruit and a gentle but not that rich malt backbone doing enough to hold the brew but not making itself felt much. 		M - Smooth and medium bodied with good but not overwhelming carbonation 		D - Very drinkable and stimulating in the same league of some reference IPAs and assertive PAs. 		Notes: Not only there was little worth calling pale in this brew, but it seemed that in terms of style it should switch places with the one offered labeled as an IPA, which is the far more nuanced and maybe balanced brew. This one was a rather tasty and pleasing IPA, or PA leaning heavily on the IPA side. For me it wasn't even a borderline decision, but this wasn't a troublesome choice, quite the contrary. After tasting all their nice house offerings of the day this was by far the most pleasing brew and fresh growler made the way back home with me.",2009-10-05 21:37:48
,4765,1500,Brown Hound Brown Ale,English Brown Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,CheckMate,4.0," 1/2 gallon growler obtained at Whole Foods in Portland, ME. pours a hazy amber/brown color with a half inch of off white head that dissipated after a few minutes. scents of chocolate, earthiness from the hops, maltiness, and a hint of diacetyl. tastes of chocolate, malt, earthiness, citrus and butter play on the tongue. the diacetyl is very slight and balances the other tastes in the beer. light to moderately carbonated and leaves a slight earthy aftertaste. the first sip invites another. 		Cheers!",2009-10-05 21:38:21
8.0,652,24,Traquair Jacobite,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,drtth,4.5," Lightly chilled and poured into a Duvel glass. A glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. 		Appearance: The beer pours out a dark brown with reddish highlights. The beer would be clear if not so dark. There is a  to "" thick dark tan head which recedes fairly soon. Sipping leaves a ring and a combination of leggy and spotted lacing. Eventually the head recedes to a ring of foam with a light surface layer of foam and sipping leaves some scattered lacing for as long as the ring persists.		Smell: Until the nose adapts, the aroma is clearly and definitely present, even 18"" away. Up close the aroma is rich and complex and contains dark caramel mixed with brown sugar and molasses. The coriander is clearly present here and seems to be mixed with traces of dark fruits (raisins and plums).		Taste: The rich malt flavor starts with a dark caramel character and then turns into brown sugar and milk chocolate. Soon the spiciness of the coriander blended with the fruitiness of raisins and plums shows up on the scene. Throughout, the sweetness is quite restrained and subtle.		Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium bodied and silky smooth with soft carbonation that gently tickles the mouth. The finish is long and eventually turns dry, but without any real bitterness. There are neither hops nor alcohol showing here.		Drinkability: This is definitely a beer for sipping, and if I had another I'd be hard pressed not to open it tonight. But as things go, I'll surely be looking to have this one again. The complexity of this beer more than justifies the price to have as an occasional treat.",2009-10-05 21:40:18
5.2,53130,1114,El Hefe Dunkle Gone Wild,Dunkelweizen,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,Deuane,4.0," A-Very deep, dark brown with a thin tan head that reduces to a thin veil and leaves spotty lace.		S-Lightly tart with notes of sour cherry and oak.		T-Dry, like brut champagne. Is there really hefe yeast in this? The brett must have eaten it all! Dry and tart with an oak finish. Merlot like notes in the drying finish.		M-Medium-light bodied and did I say it was dry? Lingering oak bitterness.		D-Interesting and oh, it's dry too! So dry and oaky---&gt;nice! I couldn't drink a ton of this but to sit and enjoy and glass, yes!",2009-10-05 21:42:35
5.2,2266,378,Bar Harbor Blueberry Ale,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,smanders,3.0," Not usually a ""fruity beer"" kinda guy but my brother offered and you never want to turn down a free beer, right? 		I should've known by the aroma that this wasn't going to knock my socks off but I tasted it anyway. If I'm going to interrupt my regular beer drinking with a fruit beer I expect something that really tastes like fruit; fresh, fragrant, almost healthy. This wasn't it. The minimum amount of blueberry noted was quickly forgotten once the liquid left the palate. I knew there was a reason I didn't drink fruity beers often...",2009-10-05 21:43:23
8.0,36179,3818,Hoppe (Imperial Extra Pale Ale),American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,nick76,3.0," The aroma is papery with citrus, yeast, and sour dough bread. The appearance is hazy gold orange with a large head. The flavor is like the aroma with a bitter, cardboard finish. The palate is smooth but no outstanding. Overall this is just one of those underwhelming beers that does not suffer from quality problems it is just not that outstanding.",2009-10-05 21:43:23
7.6,99,142,Spaten Optimator,Doppelbock,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,drcarver,3.5," I have had this beer numerous times in the past and love it. This is a review for the past bottle I had.		A - medium brown body with 1 finger of off white head. No lacing, little retention.		S - Smells like a good pizzeria. Malt, spice, breadiness, and a hint of smoke.		T - almost soy sauce like flavor with roast malt throughout		M - Surprisingly light-medium bodied with an astringency short lived aftertaste.		D - Love it and could easily kill several in one session. Although I was shocked to see the ABV in the 7s.",2009-10-05 21:43:36
6.2,51573,96,Odd Notion (Fall 2009),Belgian Dark Ale,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,DannyS,4.0," Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.		A - Pours thickly; a stout-like pitch black with very little head. Despite the lack of top foam, it looks velvety smooth.		S - Roasty coffee, smoky notes, and a background aroma of dried fruit. Picked up an occasional whiff of some sort of unpleasant mustiness.		T - Very roasty bitter with a twinge of sweetness in its robust, smoky profile. A slightly sour, fruity profile begins to seep through as it warms. Does not finish dry, but the bitterness lingers.		M - Thick, smooth, and pretty fizzy. a good balance of textures.		D - The ABV is a titch high and the bitterness does stick around for a while, so it's not really a session brew, but finishing a whole glass is not difficult at all.		Overall - It's officially a Belgian ale, but seems to carry traits of stout and even rauchbier. A delicious mutt of a beer.",2009-10-05 21:44:19
5.0,717,256,Downtown Brown,English Brown Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,n0rc41,4.0, Good all around beer. This is my girlfriends favorite beer so far....Poured into a pint glass. nice dark color with brown creamy head. Tasted of dark malts and little nutty-carmel tastes to it. went down smooth with nice after taste. I had thsi beer on tap and in the bottle. I prefer it out of the tap....from a pint glass I think it tasted better....,2009-10-05 21:44:25
5.0,571,113,Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout,Oatmeal Stout,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,SamN,3.5," Purchased a bomber from Supermarket Liquors in Fort Collins. Poured in an Samuel Smith pint glass.		A- Nearly perfect black, with just a little light coming through the glass. Billowy light tan head that hangs around and sticks to the glass. The head is thinner than you'd expect, more like the head on a Belgian beer than an English stout.		S- Malt smell, the sticky sweetness of the oats is just noticeable, light apples and pears, and a hint of grassiness. Pleasant, but kinda weak.		T- Not your usual stout; the oat mash really transforms this stout into something different; a grainy sweetness dominates the taste, moving to dried fruits and finishing with a disappointing old dishwater close. It's like they gave up halfway through the taste. It's good, but the taste is a little too thin and transparent for an olde English oatmeal stout.		M- Medium bodied, and a chewy texture makes each sip a pleasure to wade through. Very little carbonation to speak of.		D- Good, seems like it would go good paired with a roast and thick stew. No chance of this beer overpowering your meal.",2009-10-05 21:45:53
4.6,401,118,Dark Island,Scottish Ale,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,abuliarose,4.0," Poured into a snifter, revealing black opaque body with a dense and creamy-looking head. Smells a little boozy and a little like molasses, quite sweet. Notes of dark fruits. Slight dry sourness.		Tastes very interesting. It has the same astringency as black tea and is surprisingly medium-bodied. It kinda reminds me of the asian black jelly you can buy in cans. Roasty, a hint of sourness and very gentle bitterness that doesn't penetrate the tongue. Mouthfeel is ok with its medium to watery thickness and tiny, rounded carbonation. It's fairly drinkable excepting the odd tea flavors.		This is my first Scottish ale, but based on my findings I'll be comparing other like beers to this style in the near future.",2009-10-05 21:47:36
4.9,5044,18968,Kipona Fest,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,drcarver,4.0," A - a medium brown body with an off white head. Decent lacing, nice retention.		S - Sweet doughy malt.		T - Sweet, brown sugar like flavor with roasted malt. Sugar hangs on the side of the tongue.		M - medium bodied. Alcohol and astringent aftertaste		D - Goes down nicely and at 5% could easily session this beer.",2009-10-05 21:47:56
6.5,44727,596,Portsmouth 5 C's IPA,American IPA,4.5,5.0,5.0,4.5,ALeF,5.0," As a devoted drinker of American and English IPA's, I find Portsmouth Brewery's offering, 5 C's IPA, to tantalize an IPA-crazed persons senses!		As you pour this beer, a cloudy, orange haze fills the glass. There was very little head that formed (due to coming from a growler?), but there still was a decent amount of lacing on the sides of the glass.		This is a deliciously flavorful smelling beer. It contained the full hoppy citrus aroma that one looks for in an IPA, but it was also accompanied by a hint of spice.		The taste was that of a spicy-citrus flavor, balanced out by just the perfect punch of sweet malty flavor.		As this beer hit the tongue there is an initial bitterness that transforms into a sweet flavor, and concluded with a spicy, somewhat dry feeling. This beer left me wanting for another mouthful.		This might quickly become one of my top 10 favorites.",2009-10-05 21:48:46
8.5,42303,106,Schlitz High Gravity V.S.L Very Smooth Lager,American Malt Liquor,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,twiggamortis420,2.0," 24 oz. of the golden bull, oh yeah. Pours a light golden color with perfect clarity and a small white head that fades to nothingness in very few seconds.		Sweet maltiness with a hefty dose of alcohol is about all I get in the nose on this one. Pretty clean and fresh smelling malt liquor.		This one will get you drunk in a hurry. The sharp, rough alcohol is readily apparent and is only masked by some light grainy malts and carbonation. I do not detect any bitterness from hops, but the heavy alcohol dries out the finish enough to not taste sweet. I would much rather tame the blue bull than this golden beast...V.S.L. my ass! There is nothing smooth about it. Highly unlikely I will be buying this one again.",2009-10-05 21:49:02
9.4,40340,9550,Oak-Aged Ebenezer,American Double / Imperial Stout,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,msubulldog25,4.0," Caged/corked 750ml bottle split on a cool Sunday afternoon with my wife to a pair of snifters. Huge thanks to RedHaze for sending this last winter.		'Special Bottling' with a handwritten back label:	Beer Style: ""OAK-AGED EBENEZER""	Character: ""MALTY CHOCOLATE, SPICED, OAK""	Approved: blue signature, impossible to read...	Bottled In: ""SEPT 2008""	Brewed In: ""AUG 2007""	9.1% Alc/Vol	#677 of 1521		A: Corked released with a modest 'THUP', carbonation gusher waited a few seconds to unleash; minimal loss, thanks to quick glasswork by the missus...but be warned. Pours a murky orange-brown, though the haze tends to settle out to a clearer 'bourbon' color and consistency over time. The initial head of fizzy tan (2-fingers) loses it's aggression and settles to a creamy, never-fading cap that replenishes with each sip or swirl, leaves dabs of lace.		S: First sniffs showed strong oak and a hint at sour/paper oxidation. With some warming and relaxing, spiced gingerbread and dark chocolate accents creep in. Herbal hops, with a whiff of cherry puree.		T: Like the aroma, first taste (maybe 10 minutes warming outside the fridge) seemed overly oaky and a bit tart. With warming, more chocolate emerges and a fruit leather tang. Woody char is subtle, never get too sweet.		M: Feel is creamy, with an effervescing carbonation and a lasting earth/spice bitterness. Dull tingle grows on the tongue, a touch of tartness pulls the cheeks. Acidic tang comes and goes.		D: A nice, warming sipper with plenty going on to keep interest throughout. It was nice to see how this opened up once it warmed and the carbonation waned. The 'Imperial Stout' moniker was a little misleading, as the transformative oak-aging and heavy spices made this more 'Strong Ale' or 'Winter Warmer' in my book. Very glad to have tried this...my first taste of 'Nebraska' is a winner.		PS: Thank God for my laptop's cache, or I'd have lost this review to the big BA server glitch...",2009-10-05 21:49:22
5.9,37477,140,Sierra Nevada Anniversary Ale (2007-2009),American IPA,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,n0rc41,4.5," Poured a great dark color with great smell! tasted wonderful with great flavor! full bodied hopy, pine tree flavor. nice full flavor balanced well with the spices and hops. great after taste with awesome bitterness at the end. This is a great IPA and reminds me of a racer 5 IPA and sierra nevada's pale ale cross!",2009-10-05 21:51:33
5.6,20206,9790,Duck-Rabbit Brown Ale,American Brown Ale,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,GJ40,4.0," Sampled from a 12oz bottle in a standard pint glass starting at 48 degrees. Bottle says enjoy by 10/09.		Brown in color with a reddish tinge and a fair amount of light coming through. Good clarity and a moderate beige head that dissipates quickly. The aroma has bread, caramel and a little yeast. The flavor leads with a nice bitterness from both the hops and roasted malts. It also has a fruity hint and a nice tang to it. It's very flavorful but smooth from start to finish. The consistency is a bit thin with a moderate carbonation.		This is a very drinkable beer. I'm really starting to appreciate Duck Rabbit more and more.",2009-10-05 21:51:33
4.6,401,118,Dark Island,Scottish Ale,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,sisuspeed,4.0," The color of this beer fits the name well. Opaque dark appearance with a bit of off-white foam floating on top. Poured into a snifter.		The aroma is quite good. Woody, toasted malts, chocolate, sweet syrupy malt smell as well. A little smokey, with some earthy notes. 		The taste has lots of well roasted malts. Very smooth, creamy. Almost a hint of whiskey flavor. Little bits of chocolate. Just slightly smokey.		The mouthfeel is full, rich for a beer of only 4.6% ABV. Some tingly carbonation that could maybe be toned down just a notch, but otherwise pretty good.		This is a very drinkable beer. The bottle is already going too fast. Could definitely have two of these 0.5L bottles in a sitting. Overall, a well crafted beer. I will be picking up more in the future and would like to try the big brother of this beer, Dark Island Reserve.",2009-10-05 21:53:38
5.5,7799,1628,Southampton Pumpkin Ale,Pumpkin Ale,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,indiapaleale,3.5," Pour - Southampton Pumpkin pours a very clean and clear copper color. The head is quite thick like a dollop of Cool Whip on top. Nice and bubbly.		Aroma - A lot of spice up front. Definitely some cinnamon and nutmeg along with ginger. Smells like a can of Libby's Pumpkin Pie filling but without all the sweetness.		Taste - The spices you smell do come into play nicely as far as the flavor of this beer goes. There is some sweet, buttery caramel flavor as well but its not overly sweet. Put those things together and you've got the making of a not so sweet pumpkin pie flavored beer. The actual pumpkin flavor is hidden and subtle at best but its definitely there. Very smooth with a nice creamy finish and it leaves the flavor of the cinnamon on your tongue. 		Overall - Not bad at all. Its a very solid pumpkin beer. I'd say its exactly how the brewer describes it. Definitely worth picking up a bottle if you're into pumpkin beers.",2009-10-05 22:00:37
4.9,909,306,Killian's Irish Red,American Amber / Red Lager,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,tone77,3.0," Poured from a brown 12oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is slightly sweet, malts and grains. Taste is crisp but not a whole lot of flavor. Some malts and a slight bitterness. Feels light in the mouth and goes down pretty easily. Overall this is a fairly good beer.",2009-10-05 22:01:09
6.0,17431,433,Molson Canadian Cold Shots,American Adjunct Lager,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,shirfan,2.5," This has hit WNY as ""Canadian X"", in the same red-bull-sized can and 6.0 ABV.		Pour is pale gold with some foam. Average looking.		Aroma is sweet and adjunct laden, reminiscent of malt liquor.		Taste is heavy on grain, a bit watery, with a lingering sugary sweetness. Faint aftertaste of chemicals and alcohol.		Probably a bad call unless you're a frat boy looking to boast about how many cans of beer you drank in an hour.",2009-10-05 22:01:15
7.5,6076,651,Flower Power India Pale Ale,American IPA,3.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,OnThenIn,4.0," Appearance: The beer pours a rather cloudy darker straw gold color and has a nice finger of slightly off white head. There is a good amount of lacing and the head sticks around for a bit. This beer was poured into my DFH signature glass.		Smell: This aroma is wonderful. I mean this is a very original smelling ipa. There is a great deal of flower and fruit. There is not as much of the traditional citrus fruit smell and I really can't detect any passion fruit which is a cool change. There is also a hint of pineyness. I am just very impressed with this aroma. Tropical is the best word to describe it.		Taste: I have a great deal of bitterness, which opens up to a tropical flavor that has a great deal of citrus flavor that is wasn't in the smell. Hiding behind the citrus flavor was a bit of the tropical flavor that is present in the smell, but it didn't exactly hit you with a two by four. The aroma was a good deal better than the taste in my opinion. The beer had a great deal of bitter finish, which was rather crisp otherwise. 		Mouthfeel: This has a very creamy feel and definitely a nice medium body. The carbonation is really solid, but the bitter finish ruins the smoothness, which was really pleasing me. 		Drinkability: This beer was exactly what I expect from an ipa. It was rather enjoyable and one of the better ipas I have had. I think I will get this pretty rarely, because the sixer was at least a couple bucks more than some other first rate ipa. It is rather easy drinking.",2009-10-05 22:02:11

A: Bright, clear copper color with off-white head and lacing. 		S: Sweet and flowery hop aroma, some fruity malt scents. 		T&M: Very smooth with a sweet hop and malt flavor.

5.0,778,113,Samuel Smith's Organically Produced Lager Beer,Euro Pale Lager,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,allforbetterbeer,4.0," Appearance: Typical lager gold. Slightly darker than average. White head that dissipates to 1/4 inch layer in a couple of minutes, minimal lacing.		Smell: Balanced hops and grains. Clean.		Taste: Notable hops characterize the initial flavor, blending with grains and malts, then dissipating into the minimal aftertaste together.		Mouthfeel: Bubbly and moderate to thin body.		Drinkability: Average, alcohol taste is present and noticeable.		Overall: I like this beer, it is a well crafted high quality lager. I could have stronger grain and malt in the flavor, but that is a personal preference. If you like lagers, try this beer.",2009-10-05 22:02:33

Smell is sweet, metallic and phenolic, nutty, focused. 		Taste is malty, sweet and smooth, with light phenols and dry finish		Mouthfeel is a bit sticky, pretty low carbonation, medium to medium-light body. 		Drinkability is pretty good, a very nice quad I'd never heard before this visit to Amsterdam. Still, the sweet, dry maltiness is hard to drink too quickly.",2009-10-05 22:05:55
5.0,1371,478,Labatt Blue,American Adjunct Lager,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,Metalmonk,2.5," Pours a half-inch head that thins quickly, the bubbles breaking up before my eyes to form a crown in about 20 seconds. The liquid is as clear as tap water and about as neutral in color, being a washed-out yellow/gold. 		Something about the smell is attractive. It's not repulsing me, at least. There's a sweetness that appears natural enough, a zip of cane sugar, a zap of mashed corn, a pinch of honey. Not terrible, but as other beers have proven, a benevolent smell like this can turn evil real quick. Let's see...		While the sweet/corn elements of the nose come through in the flavor, they die after about 2 seconds. Powdered sugar, clover honey and sweet corn are detected with the first drops on the tongue, and then they disappear as if they were never there. The carbonation performs a magic trick, snatching any decent flavor up in a soda-like swirl of bubbles and leaving you with hardly any kind of finish. Sure, it's ""clean,"" but ultimately that translates to ""weak and unsatisfying."" 		There is nothing here that's 100% detestable. It has potential to be a decent beer, but it feels entirely compromised, rushed and made without a whole lot of love. It's just a commodity that somehow keeps this company in business decade after decade. So many better pilsners out there, you'd be foolish to go with this one for any reason other than total desperation and total lack of any other choices. That doesn't explain why I'm here looking at half a glass I'm not enthusiastic about finishing. Drain pour? Jury's out about that at this moment...",2009-10-05 22:06:04
10.0,44755,10097,Harpoon Leviathan - Imperial IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,Seanibus,4.0," Pours deep golden with a copper tinge. The carbonation swirls in slow motion, creating a big fluffy head that clings in sticky lacing. The aroma is sweet and hoppy, with big citrus hop notes. The flavor is like a big glass of sweet grapefruit juice, wildly citrusy, a little sweet, almost cloying. The mouthfeel is tick and clingy, with a sting of carbonation on the front of the tongue.		This beer is good, but it is simply too much - the parts are good, but the sum I find punishing.",2009-10-05 22:06:49
7.7,4083,147,Stone Ruination IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,ditch,5.0," Man O Man this is good!		 Poured a light bronze with a thick creamy white head. Head hangs around for quite some time before receding to thin clumpy bubbles and a thick ring around the glass.		 Smells of hops, hops, and more hops. Floral, citrus and pine. A woody barley tries to poke through. Also I'm getting a bit of the booze.		 Taste is actually well balanced for a beer this hoppy. I expected by the 100+ IBUs, that I would be making a pucker face after the first swig. Flavor is all over. Grapefruit, pine, sweet grain (pretty bready), pineapple... some others in there too, one I can't put my finger on. Oh, this is good!		 Mouthfeel is good. Carbonation is perfect for this style. 		 Drinkability is frighteningly good for this style. I could drink quite a few of these bombers in one sitting. 		 Not sure that this is a beer to drink on a regular basis. This is a beer to get for those times when you need a hop fix. Like the label says, I think my pallet is ruined for trying anything else tonight. I'm actually new to the hop bus, but I now understand why these beers are so popular. Thank you Stone! This one is amazing!",2009-10-05 22:09:04

8.0,1631,48,Augustijn Ale,Tripel,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,jlindros,4.0," Was perusing a store for some new items, and saw this sitting on the shelf. It looked pretty interesting and wasn't too expensive. So here comes a review. Poured into my Corsendonk tulip glass in anticipation of my next beer.		A: Cracked the top and it started slowly erupting out the top, so I had to pour quickly. It poured into the glass with a big creamy pot-marked head of about a finger and a half. It's extremely clear with an amber golden yellow color, and loaded with bubbles dancing as they rise to the top of the glass to continue the legend of the large head on top. Swirling it slightly makes the head bounce around on the top in a mesmerizing fashion.		N: Lots of wheat and yeast to start this off. I get some light Belgian malts and candi sugar hiding behind the wheat and yeast. Some light citrus and banana makes its way through the cloud and into my nose as alcohol permeates through it all. It actually has a nice strong Belgian alcohol nose. This is a definite Tripel style beer. I even get some more sweet fruit like apple. very interesting and complex nose.		T: Time to taste this interesting accidentally discovered beer. Taking a big nostril in as I take the sip, an explosion of bubbles, wheat, and Belgian malts blast over my tongue. Some very warming and spicy alcohol hits next reminding you that it is 8% but hinting closer to double digits. Sweet candi sugar tempts the tongue almost erotically as it turns back to alcohol. Some light banana rocks itself through, followed with some other light fruits and perhaps apple (yeah I know thats a fruit but... shut up).		M: Semi thick, not too much, but a metric shitton of carbonation and highly spicy warming alcohol that slightly singes the tongue (and I just had a dram of a rye bourbon).		F: More warming alcohol, and carbonation start the finish. It dries off very well considering how sweet it started. The fruit really lingers for a bit and loiters illegally with the Belgian malt taste and wheat. I'll be burping this taste back for a few weeks I think.		Final thoughts: A surprisingly good tripel, and great find. A ton of carbonation, perhaps a little too much. It has some great Belgian malts and wheat tastes, some interesting sweets and fruits. I almost feel my mother should be here telling me to watch my sweets but not the fruits. The alcohol is almost a little much, even for 8%. All in all, a great beer and worth a try.",2009-10-05 22:12:23
9.5,50176,158,Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti,American Double / Imperial Stout,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,everetends,4.0," Alright, lets do this again. Due to the great BA crash of Oct 5, 2009, the review I posted last night disappeared. This is taken from notes and memory. 		22 oz bottle I received from my girlfriend, she picked it up at Green's on Buford HWY in ATL. She had mistakenly consumed my only bottle on an earlier date while thinking it was just the regular Oak Aged version. No harm, no foul. Served up in a standard pint glass.		A: Pour seems to be a somewhat viscous liquid hitting the glass and forming a black body. The body is shiny and glossy. Very nice indeed. Held to the light, there is absolutely no light getting through this body whatsoever. The pour got me about two fingers of medium brown colored head that built up easily and quickly. It does its best to stick around but falls in due time to a thin top cap. The foam has some nice sheeting but no stick. Probably the slickness of the beer is keeping any lace from forming. Not a bad looking brew, definitely wouldn't call it names behind its back.		S: Getting some chocolate coming out, thats for sure. Initially, the smell is mostly of some super sweet, manufactured, Hershey's syrup type chocolate aroma. It can be a bit much at times. As the beer warms a bit, some of the dark chocolates and milk chocolate come out. With that said, they chocolate syrup smell is still lingering and might even be dominating. There is a touch of vanilla coming through, along with some nicely place piney/resiny hops. 		T: Grrr, yet again we have this chocolate syrup presence. Its not as crazy as the smell but absolutely there. Just very sweet at times and almost a bit manufactured. Reminds me of when I was a kid trying to stretch not enough milk by using way too much chocolate syrup. The dark chocolates are present and are actually quite nice. They are accompanied by some milk chocolate as well. The malts are nice and varied but I am mostly picking up on some caramel, and probably some more chocolate malts coming through. Vanilla is nice and light, just a touch of compliment. The label says they put in some cayenne to cut some of the sweetness, but I am not getting any of that at all. It might be covered up by the hops presence though. Good amount of piney hops coming through towards the back. These add just enough bitter to the sweet. I think the hops may have been the most well crafted portion of this beer. Don't get me wrong, its still a good beer. The other flavors do a good job of making up for the chocolate syrupy flavors. Not bad, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more diversity. Maybe a bit more noticeable cayenne and some dark fruits. Still good though.		M: Full bodied beer for sure. This has a nice wieght and heaviness to it. Carbonation has a bit of tingle to it, but its not enough to take away from the beer having some size. The ABV is pretty well hidden for 9.5%. Other than a slight warmth in the belly, I am not getting any heat on the palate or throat. This runs across the palate and teases both the sweet and bitter sides of the tongue. Aftertaste is pretty much just a lingering chocolate.		D: Not a bad beer by any means. It is a bit too sweet for my liking though. It just seems to have gone a bit too far in the sweetness direction. This puts it more into the dessert beer realm that should be shared with friends (a la Southern Tier). Sadly, I am all alone on this one but I will survive. This will be slowly sipped and savored though, you have no choice. I just feel that out of the Oak Aged series I have had so far, this is the weakest. The Espresso was just a better crafted beer in my opinion. That may be why this didn't live up to expectations for me since the Espresso version was so damned good. Ah well, can't knock em all out of the park. Still a good beer and I would definitely have this again in group setting.",2009-10-05 22:13:14

S: A banana and lime citrus aroma upfront with a delicate and complimentary light malt backbone.		T: Tastes like a typical mellow blonde/belgian pale ale with perhaps some added oak character. The two things that stand out the most about this brew is the overall balance and banana-like flavors.		M: Light body and mild carbonation, which I think is suitable for this style.		D: A good tasting brew that is quite drinkable. 		Overall: I can see myself buying a bottle of this and enjoying it a hot summer day, but won't go out of my way in acquiring it.

A: Rich amber and copper in color with a two finger thick head. some areas of the foam have bigger bubbles than other areas and the head lingers for a minute or two leaving nice lacy rings.

Color is a hazy straw yellow with a lively carbonation. Thin white cap about one finger in width with good retention. It does leave some sticky lacing around the outside of the glass.		The nose is very acidic, with a firm wheat backbone. Very sour and tart, very lemony. This is a combination of a weizen and a berliner weisse, so it's a combination of a wheat beer and a sour beer. That is exactly what it smells like.		This is some tasty stuff. Sour and tart lemons, with a smooth wheat finish. Smooth yet sour, a very nice combination. I wish I could say more, but my previous review got deleted. Needless to say, this is some tasty stuff.		Mouthfeel is light and smooth, with an appropriate carbonatoin level.

Pours a hazy golden yellow with a good two inches of off-white rocky head that slowly dissipates. Citrussy American hops (C-hops?) come through strong on the aroma, with notes of orange, lemon, grapefruit, and pine. Tastes very hoppy too, but not in an unbalanced way. There's just enough biscuit and caramel to balance this very hop forward beer. Orange, grapefruit, lemon jump out immediately, with strong pithy, grassy, and piney notes, as well as a touch of cattiness in the finish and aftertaste. Medium bodied with a smooth creamy carbonation. Leaves a fair bit of lacing as the beer is drank. Very well done - definitely one of the finest APAs I have ever had, up there with Dale's and others.

Charred, chocolatey aroma. Undertones of coffee with a light fruitiness. There's a lot of charred bitterness on the palate, bordering on astringent, backed by spicy licorice flavors, espresso and a touch of chocolatey sweetness and dark fruit.

Pours a murky red amber copper color with a two finger light tan head with great retention and some of the most amazing lacing I've ever seen. It literally coated the entire glass at one point or another, and stayed until the server took the glass away.		The nose is strong German malts and hops, a true Oktoberfest. Really nice balance leaning slightly towards the malt side. 		Taste is what you would expect, sweet malts and German noble hops. A great balance and combintion of ingredients creates an authentic and great tasting lager. Very refreshing and definitely gets you into the Oktoberfest spirit.		Mouthfeel is medium with an appropriate carbonatoin level. Smooth going down with no aftertastes.		Drinkability is great! Not sure of the alcohol percentage, but this is a great session beer.

The nose is very light and enticing. I get bready malts and a nice sweetness, with the lightest of hop characteristics.		Taste is sweet malts with a bigger than expected hop presence. From the nose, I wasn't expecting this much hop action in the taste department. It's not overpower, just noticeable, while it was barely noticeable in the nose.

Cooler temperatures, leaves changing colors, and homemade pumpkin pies are just a few of the things that come to mind when I take a whiff of this beer. Aromas are of pumpkin spices, and it tastes pretty much the way it smells. This was satisfying, and I will have no problems finishing off the other bottles. ~",2009-10-05 22:43:53
,42363,898,Oxford Class Organic Amber Ale,American Amber / Red Ale,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,mountdew1,3.5," Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark reddish brown. A very thin off white head that left a small ring on top. Aroma was earthy, with some sweet malty and some oatmeal undertones. Taste was sweet at first, with a small amount of bitterness at the end. Some touched of burnt grains also. Felt watery in the mouth, didn't coat well at all. Carbonation was nice however. Easy to drink, but mouthfeel made it more of a sipper than it should have perhaps been. Not very quenching.",2009-10-05 22:45:20
8.2,49603,16285,Bitter Sable Imperial Black IPA,American Black Ale,5.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,Keffa,3.5," Bought a growler, had them pour this for it. Started off a beautiful dark amber, almost black unless light hit it. Smelled of roasted malt, some sweetness, but mainly the roast. A little hops on the aroma, but not a lot. Tasted like an exact mix of the Brown Stoat Stout and the Dancing Ferret IPA. Hoppy up front, roasted malts in the middle, hops on the finish. Hard to drink a lot of because of the strength of flavor. High alcohol %, so be wary if you come across it.		Not bad, not great. I'll try it again if Jay makes it.		Kef",2009-10-05 22:47:22
6.9,88,147,Stone IPA (India Pale Ale),American IPA,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,brewdoc75,5.0," Picked up a sixer of this when I was in WI.		A: Yellowish orange with solid, but not too much carbonation. Bright white 1 inch head on top. Drifts down to a lace quickly.		S: Tangerine and orange with a hint of pine. Slight honey sweetness. Strong aromatics		T: Beautiful hop profile with orange, tangerine, grapefruit and even some pine. Very flavorful. The malts are present, but more w/ a light, honey sweetness. Definitely a West Coast IPA. A strong bitterness in the end, but doesn't stick around too long. 		M: Lighter bodied IPA w/ good carbonation. Crisp and clean.		D: An exceptional IPA with fabulous flavors. Would like a hint more aroma though. The appearnce was solid, but not the amount of head I was looking for. Overall, this is a hop lovers dream, with tons of hoppy flavors. A showcase of the American hop as it should be. I will buy this again and again. Please start distributing in Minnesota.",2009-10-05 22:49:03
5.1,33200,96,Roxy Rolles,American Amber / Red Ale,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,Mistofminn,4.0," Had this at my girlfriends parents house with the family over.		Poured into a pint glass, this one is red amber in color with a light tan head with decent retention. Leaves nice strings of lacing.		The nose is much more hop powerful than I expected. Piney and earthy hops dominate the nose, yet there is still an almost undetectable malt backbone.		The malt backbone is a little more assertive in the taste, but the hops still dominate. Earthy and piney hops balance nicely with a caramel malt backbone.		Mouthfeel is light to medium with a slightly overcarbonated bite, but nothing too excessive. Drinkability is decent, a nice session beer.		Overall, a solid offering from Magic Hat. Nothing spectacular, but definitely makes me wonder about their other brews.",2009-10-05 22:49:09
5.4,48928,6045,American Brown Ale,American Brown Ale,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,beerthulhu,4.5," A: In the light appeared a deep mahogany, while in the glass was a dark chocolate coloring with a frothy, compact 1 finger light beige head that was well lasting while leaving a clingy spotty sheet coating down the glass walls. A good visual representation color and lacing wise while the head maintained nicely adding to the appeal. 		S: The nose was strong with sweet burnt malty tones and hints of dried pine and citrus. A bit unusal per style but was very pleasant none the less. 		T: The flavor opens up with a nice fresh roasty flavor that was deep with a dryness of pine and a burnt chocolate sweetness. A nice toasted nuttiness and lingering roasted malting hangs around for a bit with hints of earthy dried citrus tones. The beer finishes up dry, with hints of earthy peat moss, fresh charred wood and a lingering roasted malting well suited per style at medium strength that will keep you warm and cozy on a chilly autumn day. Flavor-wise iron hill seemed to up the ante a bit here exceeding expectations. 		M: spot on, with a smooth texture providing for a good hold and feel here. A good bitterness coats the tongue upon the swallow. 		D: Good drinkability and likewise enjoyment. A hearty brown that drinks like a porter with an earthy and roasty flavor that comes with a high recommend. Growler worthy by all means and my first A beer rating by iron hill that is rightfully so. At 5.4% abv just the right amount of abv to make this an American session.",2009-10-05 22:49:26

Smell is deep flowery, malty..inviting. Taste follows the nose..sweet, malty, flowery with a hint of bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and smooth..almost syrupy, but nice. Drinkability follows suit..craemy, rich very nice on the palate.",2009-10-05 22:50:23
7.9,387,124,Salvator Doppel Bock,Doppelbock,5.0,3.5,5.0,4.5,Marcrates,4.5," A - This is a beautiful looking beer. A very deep red, with a creamy thick head.		S - The smell is prob the weakest part of the beer (IMHO). There really isn't much smell to it, but if you really concentrate, it sort of has a ""sour apple jolly rancher"" smell. Odd, I know, but that's what I'm smelling.		T - What it lacks in smell it most certainly makes up in flavor. It hits you with a rich malt taste... very smooth and refreshing, and tapers off with just a hint of hops. You can definitely catch a hint of the 7.9% alcohol, but it isn't at all overwhelming, and is amazingly drinkable for this high of a content.		M - Very ""icy"" feeling. Quite refreshing for such a strong beer. The flavor sits well, and feels great.		D - Almost too drinkable for 7.9%! Be careful with this one.. it's sort of a sleeper. I could see myself losing track of how many I had quite easily.		Overall I am very impressed. This is a completely drinkable, yet flavorful brew.",2009-10-05 22:51:30

8.5,36527,4,Allagash Hugh Malone,Belgian IPA,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,ShogoKawada,4.5," A two-tier review. I made my notes while enjoying my first snifter, I will incorporate those into the live review while I have my second glass. From a 750ml, priced nice @ &lt;$9... at Gasbarros, of all places. WTF? Gasbarros is notorious for price gouging, and yet I get this well under the $15-$19 paid by most. Hmm.		A- A fantastic head on this one. Instant lacing, this is like big, billowy clouds settled on my beer. Coloration is a toffee-orangey brown, and the head is lasting for days. Looks as light as air. 		S- If they were going for a Belgian IPA, they hit the nail on the head. Floral hops are most noticeable but don't have a hint of pine, bitterness, grapefruit, or anything 'abrasive'. There's a definite saison quality here, very aromatic yeast. Mild funk, very mild, actually. There's also a faint meaty nuttiness, like almond paste is the best way I can describe it. Finishes with a twang of tartness. Complex, to say the least. 		T- Hmm. Hops are stronger than the nose would have you believe. They are the set up, though, not the main event. The hops step aside for the spicy yeast qualities that have me really digging this beer. A lot of reviews call this beer one-note... either the age has done wonders or I have a blessed tongue. 		I taste orange zest, honeydew melon, watermelon bubblegum, a mild metallic/copper note, peppercorn, horse-blanket funk.. mmmm! 		This is more aggressive than Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen IPA Tripel, and the two are neck-and-neck in my book. Houblon Chouffe has a stronger hop presence, while Hugh Malone is a bit more nuanced in its presentation, with a much stronger yeast quality. Almost too spicy... but it's not, it's awesome. This is one of my instant favorites (take into consideration that I've only had a handful of Belgian IPAs). Not as funky as WildDevil... but more varied on the tongue. Very tasty.		M- Perfect. Enough hops/peppery yeast to compliment the near-perfect body. A bit heavier than your average IPA, the Belgian-esque yeast does wonders at keeping this beer afloat.		D- High. Going back to clear out the stock. I found this beer to be more complex than what most reviews allude to. I also noticed the number one complaint about this beer was the price point, as some paid $15-$20 for this one. At $8.79, I feel like I hit paydirt... this beer is amazing for the price. I looove this beer.",2009-10-05 22:54:17
5.2,637,203,Old Speckled Hen,English Pale Ale,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,mdwalsh,3.5," A: Pours a weak head. Even with an aggressive straight down pour I was able to pour the entire bottle into a pint glass. The beer is deep golden, almost amber, with a good amount of of active carbonation. The head is light tan/sandy and shrinking fast, with lots of big bubbles.		S: Whew. I don't know if this is skunked, though it shouldn't be as it's well out of direct light, or if I just don't like the English Hops. Some deeper olfactory investigation tells me it's more so the hops. It's like a herb cabinet full of stuff I don't like. There's no malt in the nose either.		T: The taste is maltier, I can stand it, but there's still a lot of hops, which I'm finding almost soapy. But the malt is nice, a bit caramelly. Apparently ""caramelly"" isn't a word. I'm still thinking a little skunked. I may re-review this soon. 		M: Slick. Leaves the mouth feeling wet.		D: Would be better without the soapyness.",2009-10-05 22:55:10
4.0,53136,6045,English Session Ale,English Bitter,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,beerthulhu,3.5," 4.0% abv. 		A: Poured into a pint with a rolling murky brass turbidity that started from the bottom and slowly made its way to the top. The coloring was coppery-orange with a thin 1 finger creamy-whipped milk head that was well lasting and milky white in coloring. The head maintained throughout the course of the drink while leaving a sliding sheet lacing behind. Per style the nitro provided a soft carbonation presence. 		S: The nose was fresh creamy malt with a touch of fresh orange peels. A slight spiciness also chimes in as well. 		T: The flavor had a beautifully smooth and creamy malting with soft sweet caramelized grains that was slightly dry. There is a bit of faint lemon hopping while the beer finishes with a light flowery hop bitterness, a bit stronger then usual. Overall as far as English sessions go this one ups the ante hop wise, or at least tasted so, offering a bit more hop and malt wise then your typical English counterpart adding to its appreciation. 		M: light bodied with a smooth creaminess and of course very little carbonation to get in the way providing a silky smooth texture well suited per style. 		D: Decent drinkability, well hopped per style gives this a slight bump creditability wise. As far as English sessions go this was one of the more enjoyable ones I consumed.",2009-10-05 22:55:10
5.5,7799,1628,Southampton Pumpkin Ale,Pumpkin Ale,3.0,2.5,3.0,4.0,Mistofminn,3.0," Thanks to JoeyBeerBelly for this extra, Thanks Joe!		Poured into my Surly tulip. Pours a crystal clear amber red color, with ruby hints when held into artificial light.		There is something very strange in the nose...I can't quite put my finger on it. It almost smells like chapstick, or a slightly melted plastic or something...very unpleasant. I get light pumpkin and spices, but it's totally covered up by this off smell. I can only hope the taste is better.		The taste is a little better, but not by much. The chapstick taste is still there, but not as straight forward. I get pumpkin and spices, and a solid malt backbone. This would be pretty tasty if not for that strange taste/smell.		Mouthfeel is light, and slightly overcarbonated, however that actually makes this better, distracting from the strange taste. Drinkability would be much better if not, agian, for that off taste.		Overall, not a great first experience with Southampton. This could be infected, or I could be interpreting this very wrong, but it just didn't do it for me. Still, I'm glad I got the chance to try it, Thanks Joe!",2009-10-05 22:55:15
4.1,9166,6045,Raspberry Wheat,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,beerthulhu,4.0," A: Poured a crystal golen-orange with a thin, skimp covering for a head that was dull while and almost immediately dissipated. The visible effervesce was faint with only 1 visible stream of micro bubbles lazily rising to the surface. Other then that there was not much else to go on here. 		S: The nose was fresh and fruity with tart raspberries. Overall well suited per style and delivering as promised with hints of sugary sweetness that was detected several feet from the glass. 		T: The flavor was tart and fruity with a modest helping of fresh raspberries that was well mannered and not overly sweet or bearing. Honestly wasn't expecting much from this drink but was pleasantly surprised how honest the flavor was and how well balanced it was as well. Hints of sugary sweetness does come through but is well balanced by the tart fresh berries that gives this a good balance. 		M: medium full, slick and smooth with very little carbonation. A dry tart fruitiness laces the tongue sending the beer down with moderately good results. 		D: Drinkability is good, even if your not a fan of fruit/herb beers. This is not, I repeat not a girlie drink, but a very enjoyable and well balanced fruit beer, and the nature of the drink should not stop you from sampling a glass. Would make for a good summer quencher and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor. At 4.1%abv I could drink 2 or 3 of these without being overwhelmed.",2009-10-05 22:57:38
5.1,299,96,#9,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,wheatyweiss,3.0," Poured from a bomber into a SA perfect. Label is notched November of 2009.		Pours a medium straw/honey color with a frothy two finger head with decent retention. Clarity is good.		Aroma is huskey grain on the front. Middle brings sweet honey and floral noble hop aroma. Clover and bready malt on the finish. Aroma brings apricot and peach.		Flavor is apricot on the front. Sligtly citrus, but it has that dull orange flavor I associate with apricots. Slight hop flavor is there, nobles that taste floral, but weak. Finishes dry and earthy, fibrous.		Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery, carbonation is a bit harsh and much, but adequate.		I didn't even look into the site for the make-up of this beer before I tried it and I'm certain it has apricot or peach in the bill. Interesting and possibly a good quencher, but not something I would go out of my way for.",2009-10-05 23:00:35
8.5,5426,2085,Dragonmead Final Absolution Trippel,Tripel,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,brentk56,4.0," Appearance: Pours a very cloudy chestnut color with a rocky head that fades a bit quickly but leaves some nice lacing behind		Smell: Spice cake phenols, apples, unripe banana and a hint of toffee		Taste: Opens with a yeasty spice cake flavor that adds some fruit (apples and pears), grassy hops, vague bubblegum, white pepper, vanilla and alcohol by mid-palate; after the swallow, the grassy hops and alcohol move forward for a flash, but the sweeter flavors come right behind and linger into the finish		Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation; a little warmth in the gullet		Drinkability: Quite a different take from many Belgian versions of the style, this is still a very nice beer with its own character; unlike some American tripels that are too one-dimensional with tons of alcohol, this one has some subtlety and complexity; this one has aged about a year and clearly benefited from that time in the bottle",2009-10-05 23:02:42
4.5,2970,91,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,American Adjunct Lager,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,wertperch,2.5," I had one of these at a local curry house. Poured into a pilsner glass, it had a skinny off-white head which didn't hang around very long. The colour is pale straw, fairly bubbly, and if you like that sort of thing, I suppose it looks quite good.		What little nose there is doesn't bode well. A hint of grain and very little hop, faintly musty. It drinks like any other lager, with a fairly thin dry body, a light maltiness and the faintest tang of hop and grassiness. I did find it a little sour rather than sweet, which detracted from the overall enjoyment for me.		It's quite effervescent, not at all sweet, and sadly devoid of character. It's a simple and fairly refreshing brew, simple and unassumingly refreshing, as I would expect from the style.		I'm afraid I have little to say about this, other than it's an American-style adjunct lager that didn't make me retch, and washed down a chicken jalfrezi quite easily.",2009-10-05 23:06:44
8.5,695,222,Duvel,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,4.0,4.5,5.0,4.0,MrDanno96,4.5," A: Pours an opaque, light golden color with about a finger of head and a medium amount of lacing. 		S: Lots of fresh fruit comes to the nose; grains and some hops also. 		T: Lots of carbonation gives way to a very sweet, citrus flavor/oranges. Some hops and slight tartness are apparent, especially in the aftertaste. Where is all the alcohol?		M: Lots of carbonation and a medium body. Leaves the mouth tingling, but in a good way. 		D: This is a very drinkable beer - the carbonation and sweetness balance out quite well. If it weren't for the alcohol content, I would definitely session with this. This is a great Belgian style ale that is also widely available. I've seen it in my local grocery store before.",2009-10-05 23:06:59

Pleasant bitterness that lingers and doesn't smack your face.		Med+ body, med+ carbonation. acidic. smooth. 		Good single hop IPA in a Belgian style. Interesting hop character.

Lacing is non-existent. Smells sharply lactic and tannic; plenty of oak. The cherries don't really come through until it warms, and then only faintly at the end. Light brett notes. Tastes quite sour, again with a lot of lactic acid. Woody and earthy. The cherries are more noticeable here. Bone-dry finish. Medium body with prickly carbonation.

5.0,1120,139,Shipyard Export Ale,American Blonde Ale,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,TexIndy,2.5," Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Side of front label had notches for 'best enjoyed before' 10/09. It was a clear honey color with good carb streams and quick sliding lace. It had an average sized fizzy white head that settled into a collar and some foam.		The aroma was butterscotch, fruit and grains. Was weak and lacking in hop presence. Not one of the better smelling APA's out there. The taste was a little worse. Very grainy with heavy dose of diacetyl. Needs some hops to counter the sweet. Guess just not buying these as an APA - seems to be in wrong category. Just not very appetizing but not a drain pour either. 		Overall, a mess and not very good. Put it in a different category and maybe it would jump a little but this fails as an APA for me. Can't recommend. Rotation: avail here but one and done for me.",2009-10-05 23:11:13

A large white head of tightly packed bubbles form, and has good retention. Some light lace is left behind.	S: A huge citrus fruity aroma. Orange, pears, lemon, melon, and some yeast. Which I love. Though there is an odd perfume, and soapy aroma that detracts a bit.	T: Again, a soapy flavor, but it does not detract at all. Lots of fruits that follows the nose. Sweet malt and some spicy flavors. Some grassy and floral hops are noticeable. This is really good.	M/D: A full body that is low on the carbonation. Very creamy and smooth. Easy to drink.

10.3,47317,35,Samuel Adams Imperial White,Witbier,4.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,bnes09,3.5," I'll give Sam Adams a hand for brewering something pretty unique but overall, this one doesn't have that much to brag about. Its appearance is good, a deep hazy orange with a white head. The smell is similar to that of weaker witbiers with a little added alcohol spice. This one has your typical orange and coriander flavors come through but I can also taste a hint of caramel as well as a warming sensation from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is very thick, syrupy and intensely sweet, way too sweet for my taste. 		I absolutely loved double bock by Sam Adams when I tried it but this just isn't the type of beer that transforms well into an imperial style, IMO. Its not that bad, just something I wont buy again. I am the kind of person who sees a unique kind of beer and must try it simply out of curiosity so if you are like me, by all means give it a shot. However, if I am in the mood for a witbier, I will go with the lighter versions which are more smooth and crisp instead of this thick syrupy version.",2009-10-05 23:13:25

Raspberry red pour, clear with a slight haze and a small white cap. Macerated raspberry aroma, both sweet and tart. Lightly woody and vinous. There isn't a lot else to the aroma, no distinct funkiness, but the fruit is nicely expressed. The taste is largely fruity, more tart than outright sour, with a hint of sweetness appearing mid-palate. The finish is faintly tannic and dry and there's a trace of acetic acid. Very light and spritzy. Pleasant stuff, nothing outrageous, but taken as a simple fruit beer it's quite good.",2009-10-05 23:13:32

Appearance appears to be opaque black, but with light shinning though it is a deep dark red! After pouring there is the nice cascading bubbles that are always a joy to watch which form a creamy tan head that remains throughout. Good amount of lacing.		Smell is basically a slight roasted coffee.		Taste is much of the same, roasted bitter coffee and malts with a slight hop bitterness.		Mouthfeel is creamy yet watery at the same time. Very creamy towards the end when the head mixes in. Not really any carbonation.		Drinkability is pretty decent. I could have a few of these at one time, however I feel there are better examples of this style on the market!",2009-10-05 23:14:11

One finger of light tan head tops the beer with excellent retention bu minimal lacing.		Smell of cocoa, roasted malts, coffee grain and some sweet brown sugar.		Sweet dark chocolate, roasted malts, brown sugar and a bit of caramel followed by a dry, bitter coffee like finish. Good balance but the emphasis definately seems to be on the finish.		Mouthfeel is rich, smooth and semi-creamy; I think I almost quoted the can. Not too heavy, making this highly quaffable.		Overall, a solid offering from Fuller's. As stated on the can, this is an excellent after-dinner drink. Nothing is too overpowering, making this a pleasant porter to drink.",2009-10-05 23:17:09

A lot of yeast presence in the beer visually with an amazing dark fruit aroma and flavor. This is a beer i won't forget too soon. Dark fruit upfront with a caramel after taste.

10.0,31323,5318,Hop 15,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,JayQue,4.5," Good DIPA! Pours a hazy yellowish amber with a medium off white head and good lacing. Head retention is pretty good for 10% abv.		Smell is floral and piney hops, pronounced and nice. Taste is similar, some floral (simcoe?) hops and a lot of pine hops. A slight hint of alcohol, not pillowy like Blind Hog or Pliny the Younger. This beer has a bit of balance as well, not a real bitter head shrinker..probably a little caramel malt in the balance, but still a hop head's beer.		Mouthfeel is rich and crisp. Not too bitter, but plenty of hoppy goodness. Drinkability is good. I could have enjoyed the whole bomber and probably a bit more.",2009-10-05 23:22:19
10.0,25756,898,Heavy Seas - Below Decks (Barley Wine Style Ale),English Barleywine,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,kzoobrew,4.0," 2008 batch		Rich cooper to amber color capped with a small light brown head. Retention is minimal leaving no lacing.		Warm bready malt and caramel aromas. Raisin smells sit just behind. Much of any hop aroma which may have existed is now gone leaving a very malt forward nose.		Flavors is more reminiscent of an old ale but most certainly is an English Barleywine. Malt flavors dominate the flavor profile. Dark fruit much like the nose sit behind a solid malt base. Warm and inviting bready malt flavor. Very slightly boozy but enjoyable.		Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Medium bodies with rather light carbonation.		Extremely drinkable, I have never been the biggest fan of the Heavy Seas line but this one was enjoyable and my favorite thus far. While I have not had this fresh with at least a year on it is drinking well.",2009-10-05 23:23:54

The nose is pungent, sticky dank and tropical fruity hops with a splash of caramel malt. Fresh floral hops and toast slathered in melted caramel are the main flavors here. The mouthfeel is nice, medium bodied with creamy carbonation that adds to the drinkability.

9.4,46858,2681,Ten FIDY (Whiskey Barrel),American Double / Imperial Stout,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0,Bitterbill,5.0," Another tap filled bottle from my buddy NutBrown. Thanks again, Alan!		The bottle is a swing top 500ml bottle..looks like it could be a Thomas Hooker bottle.		It pours, after a nice pop, a pitch black with a 2 finger head of brown foam. There's lots of sticky lacing hugging the sides of my glass and the foam isn't shrinking very fast at all. It looks great.		Smelling is a very nice experience. Loads of chocolate, both milk and dark, hit my nosebuds along with some bourbon and toffee. It smells like a grown up's milk shake and I can't wait to dive in.		The chocolates are big and there's some coffee as well though I didn't get it in the nose.(I took some more whiffs and though it is mild, it is there) Toffee, well represented, and in the background lies the bourbon. It isn't in my face but I can definitely taste it in the finish and the aftertaste revels in it. Some warming ensues..		The foam does subside to a fine broken layer but the lacing is hanging in there. Smack. Just smacking my mouth again as the bitter and the sweet notes are very close to being perfectly balanced.		This is a full bodied brew...something I ""guessed"" when I poured it and the carbonation is just where it belongs...light. Super smooth and super creamy is what I am getting.		Drinkabilty? I wish I had a stash of this for the coming Winter season; it's *so* easy to drink that it's way scary for however strong this puppy is. Ok, I might get myself in trouble if I did have oodles and oodles of this stuff. Bottom line: This is an amazing RIS. Make no bones about it.",2009-10-05 23:27:47
9.5,1558,26,Dreadnaught IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,jlindros,4.5," So today is my 2nd anniversary of being a BA member. And, it's my 100th review spectacular! I've been saving something great for it. I almost cracked my Westy 12, but decided to save it for an even better occasion, and when I can share it with someone. Got this great gem of a beer from either AgentZero or rjacklin in great trades. Poured this bottle of awesomeness into my oversized DFH snifter.		A: It loudly chugs its way out of the bottle into the glass and leaves a light but rich head on non-pour side, and big bubbles on the side I poured on. It slowly fades to look like a frost covered head that makes me want to lick it and have my tongue get stuck to it. It has a radiant golden orange red color that's pretty clear but leaves a very slight haze. Some extra sediment and haze pollutes the bottom of the bottle.		N: Nose is loaded with fresh piny and citrus hops, and I mean loaded. I think my nostrils just ripped apart full of hoppy goodness. I do get that slight musty aroma that I get from many of the extremely hoppy beers. A light sweet malt aroma makes its way piecing through the hops and adds a slight crystal caramel aroma that's pretty nice on its own. Some other noble hop goodness can be smelled, with slight grapefruit and citrus, but get light. The nose is pretty much dominated by the pine.		T: I sure hop the taste is similar... actually it starts pretty malty and sweet, very juicy and lots of caramel. I still get a load of piny hops and citrus. Man the taste is loaded with caramel and sweet caramelized brown sugar. I also get some juicy hops fruity hops in the center, with some tropical fruits and deliciousness. Some bread like qualities top off the maltiness as the hops start to take over again. Some spicey and floral hops also come through on the back end. It's like a golf course, and the front 9 is filled with some sweet caramels, brown sugars, and breaddy malts, and the back 9 kicks you in the balls with pine, citrus, juicy, spicey and floral hops. The piney hops also happen to be your golf cart so they carry you through the entire course. I don't really get much alcohol, very slight, which is great for being 9.5%.		M: Pretty rich and very sticky. It sticks all over my mouth, holding the pine and bitterness to it. Some spicey hops and light carbonation finish off the mouth.		F: Wooo, bitterness slams you on the finish. It dries off slightly but still has a slight sweetness. It's like my dessert IPA. The crazy pine and bitterness really catches up at the end. It almost makes your mouth smack itself... somehow, I didn't really think that one through. Anyways, the ridiculous hop and bitter finish really give you the feel that it dried off more than it did. It sticks around for a bit, then just waves goodbye and that's the end of it. It fades pretty well surprisingly for how bitter it is. I also detect some citrus and slight orange peel at the finish.		Final thoughts: A great IPA. It really is a dessert IPA that dominates your mouth. I really enjoy the malt quality and caramel with caramelized brown sugar. I think that is a quality of the IPA being a little older than it should be, but I'm really enjoying it. The crazy pine and citrus hops really hang around and mingle with the juicy fruity hop goodness. It must have a combination of a bunch of great hops. I probably should drink my other bottle soon, but it's soo good. I'll have to get a very fresh one and see if it changes at all, or if this one changed, or you know what I mean. It hides the alcohol very well too. Perhaps a little too sweet too. I can really enjoy a bunch of these, probably not all in a row, but eventually.		Oh yeah, HOORAY FOR 100!!!",2009-10-05 23:27:59
5.0,10532,711,Charlie Flint's Original Lager,American Pale Lager,4.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,Shadman,3.5," One of the beers that was featured @ Medicine Hat's inagural beerfest.		Wow...talk about a bright looking beer. Clear as a moutain stream in August, brilliant amber gold. Nice bright white head, some big gobs of lacing. 		Has a very grainy aroma, husky with an almost sulphurous note. 		For a craft brew from Canada it is well crafted...Nice balanced malt in from followed by enough bitterness from the hops to keep it crisp and interesting. Maybe a tad sweeter than I like my lagers, but still the flavours are good. Does tend towards an astringent finish well after the last swig.		Gonna be a Devilish advocate and say it could have used just a tad more carbonation to give the balanced flavours a bit more crispness. 		My new favorite craft brewed lager from the Great White North. The slight astringency @ the end keeps it from being on my list of "" I'll have a 3rd pint' beers ;)",2009-10-05 23:29:38
10.0,2566,222,Maredsous 10 - Triple,Tripel,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,bashiba,4.0," Poured a nice slightly cloudy golden yellow with a huge and pillowy off white head, very sticky and tons of retention.		The smell is very tropical, with pineapple, mango, and apple all coming through along with a bit of funky yeast.		The flavor follows the nose quite well although adding to the complexity with a bold spicyness complementing the tropical fruit flavors nicely with a touch of sweet bubblegum and crisp tart apple along with just a touch of bitter hops..		The mouthfeel is slightly warm with a bit of a dry finish.		Easy to drink, very nice Tripel.",2009-10-05 23:31:27
5.2,607,192,Fat Tire Amber Ale,American Amber / Red Ale,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,curasowa,3.0," Brought back a 12'er of cans from a road trip to the mid-west. Best before date of 19Nov09. Poured a darker, yellow color with a solid 2 fingers of head that faded slowly with chunky lacing. Smells slightly of bittering hops, but mostly dominated by a grassy, almost cabbage-y aroma. The first taste is somewhat underwhelming - pretty thin and flat. Not a lot of flavor from the malt and then a slow, lingering bitter finish. Despite all that, it goes down OK.",2009-10-05 23:32:01
9.5,9659,1141,Ãquinoxe Du Printemps,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,ritzkiss,4.0," 12oz bottle pours a nice deep hazy mahogany, thin head with little staying power but a subsequent stir agitates some bubbles.		Nose is sweet. Caramel, toffee, dark fruits, hints of maple, peat.		Full body and taste. Lots of maple tries to make friendly with the traditional scotch ale: peat, toffee, earth, caramel, raisins, hints of cherry, bread, whiskey-like warming alcohol evident in the finish. Makes for a sometimes unwieldy marriage, one sip maple wins, another scotch ale. A little too sweet for my liking, maple wins. Medium body, smooth/light carb, pretty drinkable.		Not sure how I feel about this: not bad, though not perhaps at par for what I would expect from DDC. Nonethless, enjoyed drinking it though, probably, with all the selection from DDC, wouldn't choose it again.",2009-10-05 23:33:20
7.2,5441,1199,Founders Centennial IPA,American IPA,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,CHILLINDYLAN,4.5," Golden orange with amber highlights. Whitish 2 fingers of creamy head. Nice laces.		Sharp hop nose with citrus, pine, and resinous hop oils. Small toasty bready malts.		Grapefruit and resinous pine upfront and in the aftertaste. very bitter and tasty. sweet toasty bread that balances it just enough. slight alc bite.		med body. smooth and sticky		very drinkable and delicious.

10.3,33127,13014,Darkness,Russian Imperial Stout,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,kirok1999,4.5," Pours a mildly dark black, just a hint of ruby around the edges of the snifter. Thin off white head.	Smells very sweet and malty. Mildly spicy with a bit of alcohol.	Very nice sweet taste, milk chocolate and caramel. Slighty bitter and dry with some noticable hops. Lingering alcohol in the aftertaste in the form of mild bourbon.	Feels dense and creamy and very sticky.	Very smooth to sip. A really well made beer worthy of the hype.",2009-10-05 23:35:19
8.5,1385,180,Delirium Tremens,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,mooseisloose,4.5," Wow what a delicious smell in the bottle! Smells of citrus, lemons, and yeast, kind of like a lemon drop, but not in a sweet way. Pours to a cloudy bright yellow with a big head that is real foamy. Taste is also on the citrus side, sweet and yeasty, only very slight bitters in the background. Mouthfeel is fizzy, but yet very thick and chewy. I think this may be my first brew of this particular style. How delicious and refreshing. I could drink this high SG in the heat and not bog down at all. The ABV is not even evident more than it is obviously adding to the flavor in undertones. I'm delirious!",2009-10-05 23:35:38
6.8,5243,1837,Hippie I.P.A.,American IPA,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,JoeyBeerBelly,3.5," I got this brew as an extra in a trade with projectflam86, Thanks Kyle!		22oz bottle served in a standard pub pint glass.		Hazy copper color with a huge off-white head that left a lot of sticky lacing behind.	The aroma is floral and piney hop sweetness.	Upfront is the sweeter floral hop taste and then things turn bitter, harsh bitterness leads to a very dry finish.	Medium bodied with mild carbonation.	High bitterness and high abv make this a 'one and done' brew.",2009-10-05 23:36:02
7.5,3877,1471,Dark Horse Reserve Special Black Bier Ale,American Strong Ale,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,thain709,4.0," A - Served with a pitch black body...there is no light shining through this one...a creamy, mocha colored head is present...it retains strongly and leaves nice spotty lacing		S - Solid aromas coming from this...mainly dominated by milk chocolate and coffee beans...a definite roastiness apparent...some hints of vanilla as well		T - Again the taste is dominated by chocolate and coffee...the flavors are not heavily roasted to the point of being burnt...they have nice subtle flavors...the vanilla becomes more apparent and pairs with a hint of lactose...almost like a cream/milk stout...but that is not overpowering and I like that...the coffee beans come back and I believe a few earthy hops pair together to form a lingering bitterness		M - Boarding on being heavy in the body...very rich and creamy		D - I didn't know what this was when I ordered it...but I was very impressed to the point that I wanted to order another one...a solid beer with both stout and porter characteristics",2009-10-05 23:36:27
10.0,2566,222,Maredsous 10 - Triple,Tripel,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,Blakaeris,4.0," Pours hazy amber-orange in color with a massive, rocky off white head. Meringue like globs of lacing sheet the sides of the glass.		Aroma is yeasty and fruity. Slightly musty, with plenty of coriander and nutmeg. Citrus fruit, and an earthy orange peel bitterness.		Taste is bready caramel malt and candied sugar. Hints of toffee, and generous tropical fruit - notably tangerine, orange, and apricot. Finish is quite musty with vague spices and pleasantly warming alcohol.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Smooth and soft.		Tasty and smooth. Plenty of subtle complexity from citrus fruit and earthy, musty character.",2009-10-05 23:36:42
5.5,5387,1471,Dark Horse Amber Ale,American Amber / Red Ale,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,biegaman,4.0," Not so much pumpkin as pumpkin pie filling; it isn't a pure orange-amber but is actually a toasty, rather murky tone made so by shades belonging to the likes of brown sugar and cinnamon. All these muddying hues turn its clarity clammy at best. Head is wholly non-existent, even its trim seems to have precipitated. 		Dark Horse curiously lists this yeast as being an ""almost"" Belgian strain which implies not quite; I'll have to assume it isn't even though the spicy clove-like phenols and banana-fronted esters heavily imply that it is. If I didn't know any better the names ""Chimay"" and ""Ommegang"" would have instantly popped into mind. 		Like its aroma, the beer's flavour is confident and forward... not entirely with good reason. Specifics include: a few shakes of cinnamon, a whole evergreen worth of clove, a dash of pepper, a splash of lemon juice and a slurry of decomposing apples and bananas. This is spicy and only adequately malty with virtually no trace of toffee, caramel or budding hop cones that is expected of most American-made amber ales. 		Of course, it's obvious this isn't anything like most amber ales - which is something, in fairness, the brewery makes clear. And it's easy to see exactly what they were going for: an abbey-style Belgian ale. What isn't exactly clear to me is why they haven't tweaked the recipe some; the beer is overly aggressive with a considerably watery flavour. More malt is desperately needed, or at least something to scale back the that yeast. 		It is intensely peppery and leaves you in the clutches of forceful zestiness, one that fervidly gnaws away at your palate. Halfway through the bottle my palate feels exhausted while my gullet yearns for more beer, albeit of a different variety. The aftertaste it leaves is ardently biting with an almost sour note. I need something else to drink now. 		Yes, Belgian ales have characterful yeasts that brim with spice and nuance. They also, however, have poise and elegance and drink with a kind of refinement unmatched by the beers of other nations. I think Dark Horse missed that last point when formulating this beer. My personal opinion is this brewery should never mind imitating the tradition of others and stick to what they do best: making insolent, defiant ales the American way.",2009-10-05 23:36:52
4.8,935,360,Warsteiner Premium Verum,German Pilsener,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,biboergosum,4.0," This beer pours a clear medium golden hue, with a few fingers of soapy white head, which leaves very little lace as it falls away. It smells of biscuity white grain, and grassy hops. The taste is more of the same - slightly sweet light grain, and crisp, grassy, Euro-hops. The carbonation is moderate, the body medium weight and smooth, and the finish is nothing if not consistent - dry and crisp. A pretty decent old-school pilsener.",2009-10-05 23:41:02
5.1,1790,258,Peroni Nastro Azzurro,Euro Pale Lager,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,allforbetterbeer,3.5," This beer reminded me of a higher quality, cleaner version of Heineken. It is a drinkable clean lager that tastes fairly standard, with nothing against it and nothing exceptional about it. I would buy it again if it were cheap, but for a European import lager, there are better choices.",2009-10-05 23:41:12
5.0,1158,26,Pride & Joy Mild Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,KrisPaulk77,4.0," Six pack purchased on a trip to the Brewery on 07 August 09.	Poured into a standard pint glass.		The beer poured a light orange, with a minimal white head that faded away pretty fast. A small bit of lacing was noticed throughout the pint. Fairly average looking. I was actually expecting something more like a brown ale than a pale ale.	The aroma was hop forward, with citrus and pine notes evident, and balanced out by a malt sweetness. 	The taste was like a junior version of a pale ale. It was mildly hopped and had a good malt backbone. The mouthfeel and carbonation was ok. 	A decidedly average brew. Nothing special, but nothing bad about this one. Drinkability is good, and I'd recommend this one a BMC drinker trying to get into craft beer.",2009-10-05 23:41:17
8.6,38394,3818,Pumking,Pumpkin Ale,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,ujsplace,5.0," Poured into an over sized wine glass.		A: Deep, rich dark copper-orange.		S: Buttery, fresh baked pumpkin pie. Amazingly spicy aroma...pumpkin, vanilla, cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg. 		T: Exactly like is smells. Buttery, vanilla pumpkin pie with a nice mildly caramel malt sweetness, all of the subtle spicing that you would expect from a pumpkin pie, but not quite as in your face as you would expect - it is ale after all, but what an amazing take on a pumpkin ale. This is an incredibly balanced pumpkin ale. More spice and it may be overdone, any less and it would be somewhat lacking. Great balance of hop bitters and a nearly undetectable slightly warming alcohol finish. Truly an amazing seasonal offering.		M: Medium, silk-like creamy mouthfeel goes down very easily.		D: Hands down the best pumpkin ale I have ever tasted. In spite of the abv, I could really sit back and enjoy a nice session with friends and family...",2009-10-05 23:41:32

Smells mildly spicy, some sweetness of honey and a bit of corriander.	Taste is a bunch of cocoa powder that shows up late in the finish. Somewhat dry with a dusky sweetness. Dense and mildly fizzy.	Not a bad beer but not one I'd buy again.",2009-10-05 23:41:44
,53138,6421,Blueberry Lager,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,3.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,t0rin0,3.5," On tap Friday (10/2/09)		They put a scoop of actual blueberries in the glass, I thought that was interesting. The beer is murky as it leaches a lot from the berries. White foam, very little lace or retention. 		Nose and flavor are almost entirely of fresh blueberries. Enjoyable but very one dimensional. Low bitterness and a hint of booze with a crispness to it. Not much else. 		Its a novelty but worth trying once.		I asked to try the beer without the blueberries because I suspected that this was the Blonde Lager with a handful of blueberries added but when they poured a small sample I definitely tasted blueberry. Judging by how clear it was I'm guessing extract and not real fruit.",2009-10-05 23:42:11
7.8,991,368,Autumnal Fire,Doppelbock,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,bsp77,5.0," Serving glass: Poured from bottle into beveled mug.		Appearance: Rich, clear mahogany with a fantastic red glow when held up to the light. Small off-white head, which leaves fine bubbles down the side of the glass.		Smell: Strong cherry, caramel, toast, biscuit and noble hops. Smells like a cross between a Marzen and a standard Bock, with maybe a tad more noticeable alcohol.		Taste: A blast of semi-sweet cherry and biscuit malts, with some caramel and other fruit underpinnings. The noble hops provide a touch of spicy, dry counterbalance. 		Feel: Moderate carbonation, with a creamy, chewy body that isn't as chalky as some Doppelbocks are. A slight warmth serves as a reminder about the alcohol.		Drinkability: Simply a fantastic beer. While this should be a sipping beer, the tendency is to want to drink it like a Marzen. One of the best Doppelbocks out there, even if not truly to style. 		Ok, now that I have officially reviewed this, I can now emphatically state that this, Founders Harvest Ale and SurlyFest are my favorite Autumn brews. At least for now; we will see if I can find something to top them next year.",2009-10-05 23:42:14

Brown color with a short-lived beige head.	Iced hazelnut coffee aroma.	The taste is similar to drinking an iced hazelnut coffee on the first few sips, once I got over that I enjoyed some roasted malt flavors and a light bittering towards the finish.	Light/Medium bodied with a smooth feel, refreshing.	It went down easy enough but I couldn't see drinking more than 2 of these in a sitting.",2009-10-05 23:43:33

Appearance is a clear golden amber with a white foamy head that dissipates quickly. No real lacing to speak of.		Smell is somewhat grainy with slight malts. Not particularly complex.		Taste is a slightly sweet malt with a small amount hop bitterness. A very pleasant tasting and balanced lager.		Mouthfeel is very crisp with plenty of carbonation.

S: This beer has a very complex aroma as it warms. I smell dark chocolate, cinnamon, Belgian sugars. 		T: Taste is not as sweet as I was expecting. It does have that taste of Belgian sugar, Somewhat bitter finish tastes of raisins.		M: The mouthfeel is meduim to full and leaves a mouth-coating residue behind.

In the bottle it smells like orange, actually more like mandarin or really like clementine. Poured into a glass, really no need as it is in a clear bottle, but to see the head, which is good but gone quickly. Color is a very pale yellow. Taste is pretty much the same as the smell, orange and orange, like orange sweet tarts mostly, sweet but tart. No bitterness at all. This appears to be strictly a chick beer, along the line of a wine cooler. The only time I would return to drink this is in 98 degrees and 90% humidity, where it may be a good refresher. Otherwise I'll steer clear.",2009-10-05 23:47:15

If someone gave this to me in a glass without telling me what it is, I'd be inclined to think cola. It would be nicer if the head had some more dexterity.		S: As soon as I opened it this beer filled the air with a nice malt and candi sugar aroma. Very sweet, no hops. A little vanilla. Actually reminds me of some quads I've had. Particularly the cola-ness.		T: The cola continues, though I get a little earthiness as well. Then, in the almost aftertaste, a bit of sour. Though on the cola thing, there is much less sweetness than in the nose, it tastes much drier. And it's lighter than the nose would have lead me to believe. I get a little bit of caramel or cooked/burnt sugar, like creme brulee or something. Just the slightest hint of a roasted bitter, but not any hops at all.		M: Very light bodied, sort of ""dry"" in the I don't really feel it afterwords sense. A little sparkling. 		D: A very drinkable Belgian I think, though I'm just not crazy about it myself.",2009-10-05 23:49:34
,53139,6421,Amber Ale,American Amber / Red Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,t0rin0,3.5," Sampled last Friday (10/2/09)		Pours clear, red, and with a white head. Minimal lacing and retention.		Aroma is sweet, malty, a caramelly. Flavor is a bit off for an amber but thats why I enjoyed it. It was lacking that crummy chalky quality that Ambers have. Medium bitterness. There was also a bit of citrusy quality to the beer, which seems to be a recurring theme in the beers I sampled that night.		Body is low/medium, drinkable. Forgettable but decently made.",2009-10-05 23:53:29
9.0,19488,273,Sweetwater Happy Ending Imperial Stout,American Double / Imperial Stout,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,taylorhamrick,4.0," Pours a nice deep black color, with a nice tan head, about 2cm+, nearly brown, with kind of dense bubbles, that leave pretty nice lacing, sticking all over the glass. I like the way it looks, but a lot of impys can look this good. The smell is nice and chocolatey, a bit of roastiness, maybe some coffee notes, but sweetened, mocha, type coffee. The smell doesn't really wow anyone, but I think that it is very good - particularly because it doesn't have some fruity, hotter fermentation temperature type smells, not a lot of hoppy bitter smells (I don't dislike hops, but they must be done properly in a stout). If it had just a bit more of that roasty note, I think it would be a bit more impressive. The taste is good too. Nice and clean, a good hit of sweet coffee, dark chocolate, quite a nice dark, almost bitter dark chocolate. This really captures the kind of flavors I like in dark roasty foods, with enough sweetness to keep it from being annoying. I can sense the booze a little more than I'd expect at 9% and with the decent amount of age on it (It's not over a year I don't think, but I've had younger with higher ABV that I can taste less). But I'm always happy when an Imperial Stout doesn't have a really drying, kind of fruity, but very slick fermentation flavor. The body is good, nice and medium, a good level of sweetness, moderate carbonation, pretty good on the mouthfeel level. The drinkability is pretty good, too. I mean, I enjoy drinking it, it's a bit simple for the style, but quite nice and complex for a fairly drinkable beer. And at the 9% ABV, I would say that finishing the bottle will be quite managable.",2009-10-05 23:53:49

A mild brown with orange highlights, this beer had a formidible head. It was followed with a tart, twangy aroma. 		I enjoyed this beer. Enough funk to leave a tinge on the tongue but not nearly as heavy as you would think. This is a drinkable beer, with a boozy fruit (although not a strong ABV), nutmeg, and pumpkin? taste.",2009-10-05 23:54:30

Pours dark copper with sparkling clarity and a half inch head of dense off-white. Plenty of stringy lacework and a solid skim coat for the duration. 		Aromatics lead off with sticky citrus oils, biscuity malt, and juicy hops. Floral, pungent, and a bit spicy.		Medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel and a chewy edge.		Resinous hops, bitter citrus, and juicy malt start the palate. A minerally dryness quickly steps forward along with grapefruit, pine, and a hint of tropical fruit.		Finishes with a lingering bitterness, citrus pith, and plump malt.		Side by side with the Wet Hop Harvest Ale, the Estate is slightly less hoppy all around, but the malt seems to shine through a bit plumper and juicier. The Wet Hop also has the added dankness from the wet hops.		Tasty stuff. Kudos to SN for this labor of love.",2009-10-06 00:00:16

9.3,48224,694,Flying Mouflan,American Barleywine,2.0,4.0,2.5,4.0,Damian,3.5," Drank from a 1 pint 6 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Bauer Wines & Spirits, Boston, MA	Served a snifter		The cap came off with no ""hiss,"" making me wonder if I got a bad bottle. Into my snifter, the liquid poured a murky, muddy, burnt umber color with practically no head (just some frothy, short-lived bubbles).		The aroma was nicely balanced. Super malty and sweet with a piney, hoppy backbone. Rich caramel malts and brown sugar notes came through strong. Some raisins and prunes were noticeable as well. A bit of brandy-like alcohol was also detectable.		Unlike the aroma, the taste was outrageously hoppy and unbalanced. A touch of sweet maltiness appeared up front before the potent hops took over. The hops were super piney and citric. Some ripe fruits (peach, plums and raisins) came through in the center along with a touch of brown sugar. The finish was punishingly hoppy. Once again, C-type hops dominated. Grapefruit zest came through strong. Bracingly bitter and almost biting. Near the beer's end, the hopiness toned down quite a bit, allowing the rich malty sweetness and overall flavor complexity to shine through. The citrusy flavors began to remind me of candy-dipped orange slices.		The mouthfeel was surprisingly frothy and creamy with a very fine and mild carbonation. Somewhat syrupy. The liquid left a sticky residue on my lips.		At 9.3% ABV, the alcohol in this brew was rather well masked. With a hop bill of this magnitude however, I was not surprised.		Six months in the cellar was clearly not enough for this beer. Putting too much age on this however might result in a flat sticky mess. (The carbonation in my example was already quite low.) This definitely needs some careful cellaring to unveil its true potential.",2009-10-06 00:03:48

Pours a clear yellowish gold, almost straw coloured, big and thick bone white head forms, slowly settles down to a pretty thick ring around the glass, lots of lacing sticks. Smell is quite sweet and sugary, some honey, floral, light grassiness, kind of watery, almost a fruit juice/pineapple sort of aroma. Taste is similarily not very good, very light and grainy, grass, light fruit, some floral, hay, corn, kind of lemony and grainy tartness, sweet and corn syrupy. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation. Not awful but not very good.",2009-10-06 00:05:37
,53141,6421,Hefeweizen,American Pale Wheat Ale,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,t0rin0,3.0," Sampled on Friday (10/2/09)		Everything about this beer is meh. I knew I was in for a treat when the bartender put the sampler tray down in front me and I noticed that it was spelled ""Hefenweizen"", hmm. It was spelled correctly on the board however so I won't have to stoop so low as to title this beer Hefenweizen.		Hazy, yellow, decent head but it doesnt last. 		Aroma is wheaty and sour. I pulled the lemon from the edge of the glass as soon as the bartender put it there but it may be affecting the qualities of the beer.		Flavor is a bit sour from the wheat. Tastes like a typical American attempt at a hefeweizen. Low bitterness and low enjoyability. But I guess there are those that like this sort of thing (Widmer).",2009-10-06 00:05:45

I sat out on my patio and drank this very slow to make sure I enjoyed every single drop. While I was drinking I noticed I was pushing my tongue down into the beer in the glass.(Lapping like A dog after A 4 mile run on a 90 degree day!). My girlfriend utters the death phrase, ""Why don't you put a lemon in it?"".noway! I was not going to mask the flavor of this beer with a piece of fruit.	 I have seen this beer countless times and never picked it up. This beer was rocking! I wish i was drinking it at this moment. I have tried so many heffewissebiers in the past 6 years.

7.0,38818,42,Chocolate Indulgence Stout,Belgian Dark Ale,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,bminor7,4.0," 750 ml from Westmere Beverage in Albany, NY.		A - heady foam, dark brown, an unusual shade. looks like the crema from a good coffee. sticky lacing. beer is a dark brown, opaque.		S - chocolate, alcohol, candi sugar - very Ommegang-like.		T - immediately after poured, taste is a rich dark roasted malty boozy chocolatey coffee. the chocolate flavor is not nearly as predominant as in Southern Tier's Mokah, but the coffee stands out more in my opinion. my bottle's cork had slipped out a bit sometime in the past, allowing some of the liquid to dry at the edge of the cork and bottle lip. I don't know if this affected the taste, but I do get a distinct, rather unpleasant bitter note in the aftertaste as the beer sits. 		M - syrupy, but not too much. just right.		D - low. not very sweet. the sugars and alcohol go right at the teeth, reminiscent of Aventinus.		I like Ommegang, and am glad to support them, but do not think this is one of their better offerings. Perhaps my bottle has seen it's prime already, as it is a 10-Year Anniversary Edition (1997 - 2007).",2009-10-06 00:08:08
8.0,7971,863,Pliny The Elder,American Double / Imperial IPA,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,COBeerBuff,4.5," 500mL bottle received from saulcharlesworth. Bottled date is 8/31/2009 so decently fresh considering we're in Kansas...		Appearance: This beer pours the clearest yellow, orangish amber that I've ever seen. The head is about two fingers, bright white, and interspersed with both large and small bubbles. The top is soft and billowy, and the head has amazing retention with more lacing than I ever thought possible from a beer.		Smell: The hop presence in this beer is incredible. The hops smell almost as fresh as barrels of hops at the brewery itself. Tons of pine, citrus, and pineapple scents. And a malty sweetness that's pretty much untouched as far as these nostril are concerned.		Taste: This is a hoppy mothertrucker! My fianc compared this beer to drinking a grapefruit. Not just the juice, but the entire fruit, rind and all! I love the hoppiness of this monster. The zest from the citrus combined with the bitterness from the juniper flavors creates an interesting sensation on my tongue. The end is all malty sweetness, twinged slightly with a hop bitterness that just won't die.		Mouthfeel: This beer is smooth, clean, sticky, and gooey, all at the same time. All of these sensations are so well done though. None is overdone. This beer creates a party in my mouth, and I wish it brought friends.		Drinkability: This beer definitely lived up to the hype, in my humble opinion. Its sub-$5 price point makes this beer a steal (if only we could get it out here)! The 8% ABV is well-hidden, but then again, most everything is well done with this beer. After tasting this brew, one gets the impression that nothing was accidental with this beer. I, for one, am thankful that Russian River and Saul gave me the opportunity to try this beer. Thanks guys!",2009-10-06 00:08:10

Little bit of funk and alcohol... not much though. Overall super unique and quite good.		- Refreshing and light.. so only slightly chewy and sticky.. but makes the mouth water.		- Little bit too carbonated for my liking... but its a characteristic that is unavoidable.. overall very tasty, and smooth to drink.

Smell is of liquorice, and sweet malt. Taste is chocolaty and coffee up front, thick malt middle, and a roasted, earthy bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is super smooth and creamy, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is very good. Much lower alcohol than the average RIS, makes this easy to drink the entire 550ml bottle.

A: Pours a color like the ""Burnt Orange"" Crayola crayon. Hazy and quite actively carbonated. Sitting on top is a beautiful layer of light tan cream that forms a perfectly silky blanket. Retention is fantastic and large ropes and chunks of lace are left clinging to the glass.		S: Big nose of toffee, candi sugar, and plums. Along the way I also noticed vanilla, caramel, pan roasted nuts, more dark fruit, spices, tangy orchard fruit, toasted malt, and some vaguely tropical hops.		T: Flavors of dark fruit, toffee, nuts, candi sugar, and tangy fruit. Also noted were caramel, milk chocolate, grassy hops, and a vaguely metallic/mineral flavor. The flavors are very nice, but the taste doesn't pop quite like the smell does.		M: Creamy, sweet, and slick in the beginning and for much of the middle. As the finish begins to come about, the mouthfeel turns slightly drier and spicier and also with a touch of fruity tang. Nice combo of spicy hops and/or pepper & spices in the finish, as well.		D: What an excellent surprise! I'd never heard of this brewery before last week and now I'm totally eager to try more from them. Subdued sweetness and subtle spiciness plus no hint of alcohol make for an exceptional experience.",2009-10-06 00:11:51

I enjoyed this far more than the TM, both beers being taken in large pilsner glasses during the course of a curry meal. Really traditional!		The head is quite creamy, there's a light straw-amber colour to it, with a sweet and faintly malty nose.		The body is good for the style, with a nice mouthfeel. The flavour is moderate, a little sweeter than I was expecting, with a touch of biscuit and a mildly bitter-hop finish.

The coffee adds a nice acidity. Finishes w a slight burnt roasty flavor.		M: light bodied. Would expect a bit more body with the flavor profile, but good overall.		D: A nice coffee beer.

10.9,33599,2743,Barleywine Style Ale,American Barleywine,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,ShogoKawada,4.0," From a trade, thanks augustgarage! My 2nd or 3rd Green Flash, don't usually see this one in my neck of the woods. All we get is the Imp. IPA and the Le Freak out here (got to go to MA to get them anyways)		A- From 22oz into wide snifter. A Creamy but fast-settling off-white had sits on a chestnut brown ale. Looks like a barleywine, through and through. Although I would have liked more of a head, at 10% that's probably more wishful thinking than anything else.		S- I smell sweetness, a malty sweetness that reminds me of pizza dough before you roll it out. Hmm. Fits with the barleywine, though. I smell molasses, maple syrup, smells like an empty bottle of Raison D'Extra, actually. Malt bomb at this point, can't distinguish the hops in the nose. 		T- Wow. Heavy, heavy hops that were invisible before come out swinging and counter-punch the significant malt bill. This is no joke. Almost mouth-puckering, but that's not due to a sourness or tartness... just an overwhelming blast of flavor. Hops are pine-resin-esque... but hard to place far beyond their power as the sugar bomb takes over. As in the nose, molasses abounds. I want to drizzle this over pancakes or make cookies with it. Not your average barleywine... if the hops are this strong a year later, this must have been scorching fresh. As the alcohol works my tongue over, the flavors synergize a bit better. Bumping up to 4/5.		M- Thick, syrupy, a bit hot. Not bad, not my favorite. Somewhere in the middle.		D- Moderate. No joke. A true barleywine. The sweetness got to me after a while, but the hops helped this one ease along. I'd seek this one out again, for sure... but I'd let it sit for 3-5 years at least... this one begs to be aged.",2009-10-06 00:16:05

This one was a good one!		Pours a golden yellow, not much head, some nice lacing though. I didn't get much out of the smell, crisp, not your average lemony smell though, there's fresh baked bread in there somewhere but it's not that obvious.	I initially thought this beer was flavorless, then I let it sit for about 5 mins and had to change my mind, not overly malty, they got the grainyness out of the bread without being too sweet, pretty crisp. I like it!		It is a very fizzy yellow beer, but it is also easy to drink once you let it get over the shock of being out of the fridge. Not bad at all!",2009-10-06 00:16:24

A - Two fingers of creamy off-white foam that dissipates slowly and leaves some attractive lace patterns. Slightly hazed, mostly transparent golden color with a few bubbles adhering to the sides of the glass, and a few others rising slowly upwards.		S - Very fresh smelling. Tropical fruits, zesty grapefruit rind, a touch of spice and earthy pine, and some a hint of astringent alcohol that belies the higher ABV. A well-balanced multi-grain and sugar-cookie malt backbone.		T - The taste is more pine and loses a lot of the lush tropical fruitiness. The slight booziness comes out a bit more and the multi-grain malt character also comes up front and center. A step backwards from the smell. Only mild bitterness in the aftertaste, although it builds slightly as the glass gets finished.		M - Moderate carbonation tingle, medium body with lots of oily resinous character, very smooth and refreshing. There's some light alcohol warmth that builds after a while. Not much residual feel, nor is the finish very dry.		D - Even with the higher ABV this still goes down pretty easy. I'll have no problem with the bomber, but I'm gonna go hit some Broodoo afterwards.		Drinks like a less interesting version of Time-Out. Hope it doesn't fall off as rapidly.",2009-10-06 00:19:34

8.0,35738,220,Hop Stoopid,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,Blakaeris,4.0," Pours amber-copper with a thick pillowy head that leaves sheets of lacing.		Aroma is full of rich citrus hop. Plenty of resinous grapefruit and pineapple. Caramel malt base brings balancing sweetness.		Taste is surprisingly balanced. Caramel malt comes on much stronger than the nose led me to expect. Citrus hop still holds a crisp bite along with aromatic resinous pine. Finish is clean with lingering orange rind bitterness.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slick with generous hop oil residue. 		A worthwhile American IPA. Tasty, full flavored, but not overly belligerent with the hops resulting in a brew that is very easy to drink.",2009-10-06 00:23:43

Nutmeg, clove and ginger aromas with a slight breadiness.		Bready, biscuity with the spiciness of the clove, nutmeg and ginger coming through some nice hoppiness.

7.79,47050,335,Charkoota Rye,Smoked Beer,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,drpimento,4.5," Whoa! Man, love this beer right off. Yummm.... Served with a large, foamy, light tan head and a little lace. Color is deep dark amber with chestnut hightlights. Aroma is a luscious, rich, smokey, dark malt, raisins, dark ripe fruit, leather, and a bit of dark cocoa. Flavor's about the same with sweetness coming out at the end. Great body and carbonation. Boozy at the very end. A session beer for slow, easy quaffing.",2009-10-06 00:26:09
8.74,52077,220,A Little Sumpin' Extra! Ale,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,marmenta,4.5," Poured from a 22oz bottle. No date on the bottle.		I was wonderfully surprised by this one - Lagunitas without question has done some rock solid beers in the past, however this one blew me away. This is up there with the top 5 DIPAs in my opinion (although Lagunitas calls it ""Special Ale"").		Pours a ever-so-slightly hazy amber copper, thin light orange head, good tight lasting lace.		The nose is beautiful - starts out with a sticky, pine-coney hop punch with a touch of honey but as I inhale I pick up a bit of the malty aromas - a little bread pudding, very nice balance. Piney-hoppy with essence of malt is how I would sum it up.		Great slightly-oily mouthfeel - a real pleasure. On the swallow it feels silky.		Hoppy-bitter finish but not overwhelming - this is much more sessionable than a Dogfish 90 or a Maharaja. Semi-sweetness transitions into a crisply bitter finish. I wouldn't call it a hop bomb - but it is hoppy.		Mellow carbonation, drinkability is high - it's not overwhelming, however it is a work of art in every swallow.		Good show Lagunitas - I doubted this one, and at $3.49 for a 22oz bottle at Whole Foods - you cannot go wrong.",2009-10-06 00:26:38

8.0,49700,423,Two Jokers Double-Wit,Witbier,4.0,4.5,3.0,4.0,bump8628,3.5," Corked and caged Smokestack bottle, Batch 1-2009. Served at 50 degrees in a tulip glass.		Golden-orange in color with 3 fingers of frothy white head that falls back into wisps of bubbles on top of the beer after a few minutes. The high amount of effervescence is barely noticeable through a thick, yeasty haze.		The aroma is full of spice. The obvious coriander is there but the lavender, cardamon, and grains of paradise lend a more complex spice note than most witbiers have. It is difficult to discern which of the spicy and floral tones are from the yeast and which are from the actual spices. A tart sourness is also quite noticeable.		The taste is again ultra spicy and herbal. No single spice is discernible on its own, but they team up to deliver a massive tomahawk of muddled spiciness to the tongue. Lactic sourness competes with the spices for total dominance in this beer.		The finish is pretty dry and crisp but the spices and lactic sourness combine to make finishing an entire bottle on my own a chore. This beer would be great for a tasting or for pairing with a dish at a dinner party, somewhere where each person only gets a few ounces at a time.		I had this beer when it first hit shelves and it was overwhelming, however trying it again several months later it has definitely mellowed into a much better beer. Still my least favorite of the Smokestack series so far.",2009-10-06 00:28:45

9.5,9659,1141,Ãquinoxe Du Printemps,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,mothman,4.0," Poured into Smokestack Chalice.		Pours a small  finger slightly tan head that fades down quickly to a ring around the edge of the glass. Not very much lace. Color is a robust caramel brown, somewhat hazy. 		Aroma: Wood/oak, vanilla, lots of malts, maple syrup in the background, sweet sugar, and a hint of alcohol. 		Taste: Big vanilla flavors with some oak to follow along. A lot of malts which is normal for a scotch. Alcohol and ends with maple syrup. They maple syrup is good, but it brings a lot of heat with it. 		Mouthfeel: Smooth, a little crisp, and hot. Medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Ends with a pretty clean aftertaste. 		Overall, a decent beer. I am not for sure, but I am guessing all the sugar in the maple syrup had something to do with all the alcohol in this beer. I think it would be a lot better if the abv was able to be toned down a bit. I do like it that I can taste the maple syrup, however. An interesting brew, maybe not worth the price tag.",2009-10-06 00:32:21
,53144,6421,Raspberry Hefeweizen,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,t0rin0,3.5," Sampled Friday (10/2/09)		This is the regular ""hefeweizen"" with raspberries added. The appearance is pinkish which makes me wonder if this contains real fruit. Small head that dissipates quickly.		Aroma is still wheaty but with some raspberry as well. Better than the crumminess of a regular american pale wheat ale but not great.		Flavor is the crummy american pale wheat ale with some raspberry in it. The raspberry and the wheat both add a touch of sourness. 		Medium bodied, interesting, moderately enjoyable.",2009-10-06 00:35:45
9.5,31503,3818,Big Red (Imperial Red),American Amber / Red Ale,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,biegaman,4.0," Big Red's hue and intensity are fluid, constantly shifting as I hold the beer away and then into the light; more often than not it is 'big orange'. Its rigidly white surface, slightly aglow by the lustrous tones beneath it, reminds me of the Moon's surface. The lacing it imparts, scattered and disjointed, reminds me of an American abstract expressionist painting. 		This aroma does to me what sugar does to children: its makes me all hyper and I start running around the room, talking excessively fast and joyously jumping up and down about God knows what. It smells like Southern Tier took mashed together some really fragrant flowers with bubble gum, dipped the concoction in pine syrup and then wrapped the thing in scorched caramel. Oh yeah, that's the stuff. 		This brewery isn't one to discriminate against either hops or malts - they make some of the most delicious malt-centered stouts as well as some of the most dynamically hoppy ales. Big Red is the best of both worlds. It has the nougat-infused, toffee flavoured, caramel dipped maltiness *and* the grapefruit laced, citrus soaked, pine drenched hoppiness. What I'm enjoying most is the uncanny taste of watermelon. 		Big Red is big on flavour but not nearly so big on filling you up. The alcohol is just about insensible and as far as drinkability goes, it might as well be measured in units of hours, not bottles. Once again that malt/hop combo is an effective punch; chewy sweet malts and resinous, sappy hops please all parts of the palate. This mouthfeel is a perpetual seesaw that goes between nougat-filled sweet toffee cake and earthy, vinous flower-laced citrus. 		At the outset of this review I mentioned that the beer possessed a physical likeness to a piece by some American abstract expressionist. Turns out, the beer also shares a figurative likeness to American abstract expressionism as well; just as that specifically American movement achieved worldwide influence and put Americans at the center of the art world, so too have ballsy, characterful beers like this done so for American craft brewers.",2009-10-06 00:37:13

5.3,52633,35,Samuel Adams Coastal Wheat,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,xenolithic,4.0," I poured this wheat beer vigorously into my Weizen glass and got a 1 finger white head that was slightly rocky with the odd larger sized bubbles. The beer itself is a pale translucent yellow, much like unfiltered apple cider. It's hard for me to kick the wheat beers of the summer and move into the Oktoberfests of the fall and stouts of the winter.		The smell of this beer is pleasant, and strong enough to smell ""bready"" scents from the opening of the bottle. A hint of the lemon peel also comes through on the tip of the nose when a nice sniff is taken.		The taste brings the lemon to the forefront. More the slightly bitter peel (as advertised on the bottle) than the flesh of the lemon. I believe that it brings a nice edge to the beer, a little bit of bite where there could be hops. Again we get a little bit of bread in the taste, but not as much here. The finish is drying and thirst quenching, why did I wait so long to try this? All of the hot days are gone!		The mouthfeel is a little watery to a hair oily. I think it suits the beer, but would prefer a little more body.		Drinkability is fair, I could see myself kicking back a couple of these on a summer barbeque, or next to my favorite fishing hole. I however, am glad to be moving on to the dark beers of fall.		I can see myself revisiting this as it's another pleasant offering from Sam Adams. It's what I've come to expect from them, a solid beer with some good flavor.",2009-10-06 00:40:52

Pours mahogany with a burnished ruby hue and a short head of beige that dissolved as quick as cola. A placid surface with zero lacework for the duration of the glass.		Aromatics lead off with acid-laced red wine, dark fruits, tannic skins, and vineous funk. Hints of wet sock on oak, cedar, spruce resin, cinnamon and the trademark juniper/quanine RR yeast. Earthy, tannic, fruity, and vineous.		Medium bodied with a quenching, puckering mouthfeel. Slick and crisp.		Cherries, Currants, grape must, robust wine, and vineous malt start the palate. A swift tartness steps forward as well as warming alcohol, lush fruit, pine bark, cedar dust, and oakey undertones.		Finishes with a lingering tartness, an extreme vineousity, and an incredible depth of flavor. 		What a great beer. Side by side vs. T20 I prefer this one. Much more depth of flavor and juicier. Not quite as funky and dry as the T20 though. I can only see this getting better with age also. Yikes.",2009-10-06 00:42:53

Around one finger worth of head with decent lacing.		Smells like a bouquet of flowers mixed with an apple orchard in spring.		Very interesting taste reminiscent of the 90 min but with a definite variation. Very nice hop hit at the front with some citrus undertones. Decent alcohol at the end but not in a bad way.		nicely carbonated		This beer will sneak up on you and hit you over the head be careful,2009-10-06 00:43:06
7.0,6260,10099,Punkin Ale,Pumpkin Ale,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,littlekidlover,4.0," I poured my Punkin Ale into my beer tasting wine glass. It pours a pumpkin color, it looks like autumn. I expected it to look more like a brown ale referred to on the label. The white head did not stick around too long. The aroma reminded me of an amber with evidence of the pumpkin pie spices. The taste is caramel malts and more pumpkin pie spice (nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice) The mouthfeel is rather light for a beer of this sweetness. I probably wouldn't want to drink too many of these on account of the sweetness, not really a session beer. I have to admit, I did not dislike this beer, but was a little underwhelmed considering it's price point. I have had better pumpkin beers at the same price for a 6 pack versus this four pack.",2009-10-06 00:43:22

5.9,52776,29,Michelob Rye P.A.,American IPA,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,Darugo,4.0, Im not a big IPA fan but this one is different. I got the beer in the fall sample pack because I like the port and wheat beer. This one has a nice color and thick head. It smells of citrus and flowers. The first taste is not the bitter you would expect but darker. The finish is bitter on the back of the throat and lasting. Some malt flavor so I see myself drinking this one again.,2009-10-06 00:45:48
8.0,43080,13307,It's Alive!,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,philipquarles,2.5," 75cl bottle. Pours kind of a nasty yellow-brown with a smallish off-white head. Sweet, yeasty smell. Brown sugar and some very light Brett character. Faintly fruity. Not very pleasant. Very yeasty taste, again fairly sweet with a bit of fruit. Very restrained Brett notes. Hops evident toward the end. Light-medium body. An underwhelming take on this style, that I really just don't want to drink much of.",2009-10-06 00:46:02
5.0,5432,194,St-Ambroise Apricot Wheat Ale,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.0,laituegonflable,3.0," Pours a pale golden colour, with enormous off-white head, thanks in part to glassware design, but it sinks in a nice uneven way, leaves a nice thick web of lace. Slow bead, looks pretty good, although I might like more haze? Maybe it's just the use of the word ""wheat"" in the name.		Smell is intense with very rich ingrained fruit syrup aroma. Smell is very sweet and fragrant, with an almost resiny depth to it. Slight tartness as well saves it from over-saccharine character. Pretty good, actually.		Taste is unusual, particularly the finish, but I'll get to that later. Tastes first of that apricot flavour, slightly artificial in its sweetness, then a bit tart on the mid, but also quite watery. Just a slight sour hint in an otherwise bland and thin mid-palate. Finish has more typical bitterness, with a dank hoppy character and a slight cloying yeast flavour, plus more of that resiny fruit syrup character. All OK but less fruity than I might like or expect.		Mouthfeel is disturbingly thin and doesn't have a lot of body at all. A bit sticky which is OK but it's predominantly pretty thin. 		Drinkable enough, but not very.",2009-10-06 00:47:36
8.0,28992,12959,St. Vincent's Dubbel,Dubbel,4.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,mikesgroove,3.0," Finally was able to try this one. Amazingly had not tracked it down prior to last night. Served cold and poured into various tasting glasses throughout the night, this one was consumed on 10/04/2009.		 		Great pour with a wonderful dark color and a really full tan head that reached a height of around two inches before it finally settled down with a good bit of side glass lacing and a nice amount of foam to it. Aroma went south for me though,. Not really much in the way of balance here. Light frit, lots of brown sugar and light, musky aroma. A bit unsure where to place it really. Warming does not seem to assist that matter. Still too much bready tones for me and not enough fruit. Light would be the optimal word here. Nice strong feel to it though and it assists somewhat in trying to get the flavor back on track, but it really just does no do it for me.		 		Overall not real sure what to make of this, I wanted to like it but it just did not seem to hold up well for me. I am a huge fan of the brewery and this is really the only thing I have no liked.",2009-10-06 00:49:47

8.0,53145,20417,White Birch Wild Ale,American Wild Ale,4.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,mikesgroove,5.0," What has Bill done. I will tell you what we have here. We have the beginning of the redefinition of the American Wild Ale. First off let's get the semantics out of the way. Batch one of the beauty in its wax capped bottle is brought up to cellar temp and decanted into an oversized wine glass to make sure the full nose is there for all to enjoy. Consumed on 10/04/2009.		 		Wonderful pour here as the rich amber color just softy drops into the glass. Light sediment begins to form on the bottom as a touch of a light head takes shape. Nothing huge here, but two and a half inches at least are capping the glass at its peak and dropping loads of spider web like lacing all throughout the night. I am itching to move in for a closer look. Then it hits you, it is unlike anything else you have encountered before. Notes of dark fruit, plums, raisins, are immediately noticeable as is the rich oak notes that are coming at me. Nothing sours here at all about this one. Complex sugary notes dancing around with a touch of a grape skin like tartness hidden way in the back. Interesting mix of flavors here for sure. The balance in flavor here is sublime and I have to admit I am utterly floored. Oak flavor all over this, just wonderful woody notes that are soaked with a rich spiciness that I can only equate the yeast flavor in a perfect quad. Again with the grapes and plum notes offering just that light touch of fruit flavor before melding back into a super dry finish. Small touch of tartness again as it fades away.		 		Overall I am not sure what to say here. First off an American Wild Ale does not have to be a sour and that is something we are all going to realize soon enough as brewers start to take chances and push the limits of what can be done with flavor. This is a perfect example. Load in a couple of strains of yeast, throw at it some oak chips and let it ride! You never know what you might find. In this case one of the most flavorful and easy drinking experiences I have ever come across.",2009-10-06 00:51:55
5.6,51869,132,Maierfest Lager,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,jmalex,3.5," I keep finding Rogue beer that I haven't had. Will it ever end? I hope not.		APPEARANCE: Pours into my Victory willibecker a somewhat murky orange amber with a rocky off-white head. It starts at about 2 finger's height and drops slowly to a complete thick surface covering. Impressive head retention for sure.		SMELL: This smell quite traditional which isn't what I expected from Rogue. Biscuity and caramel with not much of a hint of sulfur. It's restrained yet robust and really fits the style.		TASTE: Well, there's the non-traditional I was looking for. Perfect bready caramel, but that's where the familiar Oktoberfest qualities end. The acidulated malt gives a Berliner Weiss-type tartness though MUCH more restrained. It takes on the flavor of orange somewhat. Damn if it doesn't actually work in this. There's also a much more aggressive hoppiness (comparatively) that stands up to the crazier flavors going on here.		MOUTHFEEL: Crisp and light with a carbonation that can hold up to it. Nothing wrong here.		DRINKABILITY: Ok, I have to dock it a bit for being a little bit out there. A 12 oz. bottle would have been acceptable for me.		This is certainly interesting and I wonder if the acidulated malt had such an effect on this beer or if it's due to something more sinister. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt though and recommend that you try this for the experience.",2009-10-06 00:52:19

Had my friend, who doesn't like stouts, get a sample and pour it into mine so I could have more like a 5 oz. sample instead of just over 2. Black viscous pour, dark tan nearly brown head. Roast malt, booze, chocolate, light oak, hint of dark fruit aromas. Sweet malt and molasses up front and a good dose of caramels and chocolate. Some vinuos fruits. Would have liked more roast, though there was some through the finish. 	Solid sticky body. 	This was all right, but I thought the barrel played made this just a bit too sweet compared to regular SC.

9.0,28318,12959,Captain's Reserve Imperial IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,mikesgroove,4.5," Brand new bottles and I was able to score one with the quickness. I decided to bust them out last night for everyone to get a quick try. Served cold and poured into a pint glass.		 		So clear. That was the one thing I really took away from this one. It had an amazing amber color to it and the clarity was really just spot on. I was shocked by the color on this one as it really just shined through beautifully. Nice big head of white on the top settles down nicely over the top of the glass. Aroma is huge citrus hops. Tons of grapefruit and orange flavors are all over the one. Really nicely done I have to admit. Solid malt backbone starts to come into play as it warms, but the pungent hop notes really just dive straight forward here. As I take the first sip I notice the body is fairly light on this one, not bad at all, just a little light. Rich flavor though quickly puts any of those thoughts aside. Wonderful touches of grapefruit and orange peel just tear at the palate, dry as could be you are quickly immersed in this wonderful brew. Smooth with all the ABV more then well hidden, I am easily able to continue down the road and enjoy it time and again.		 		Overall I had this one tap a while back and I have to say I am enormously impressed once again. After being disappointed in the dubbel, this was a welcomed change.",2009-10-06 00:53:26
10.0,41734,13307,Monk's Elixir (Monk's Brew),Quadrupel (Quad),4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,mikesgroove,4.0," Big thrill to see a bottle of this one in my fridge. Wrapped and caged I brought this one over for dinner last night. Served chilled and poured into a snifter.		 		Big dark brown pour here, nearly totally opaque with not much other then some light notes of reddish tint shining through on the sides and the bottom. Lots of light tan color foam on top reaches a height of around three inches then settles down nicely coating the inside of the glass. Rich notes of caramel, dark fruit, prunes, grapes, apples and a nice little bit of spice all playing off one an another quite well. Warming brings out even more sweetness and really gives it quite a bit of depth. Smooth with very subtle flavor here. Surprised there is not more of a boozy kick to be honest, but very well done here. Rich again with great fruit notes, and earthy spice like flavor and a touch of wood. Light finish, dry with a good bit of dark fruit sitting on the tongue long after the last sip.		 		Overall very solid, a nicely done version of the style for sure. I would have no issue at all with trying this one again, in fact I would very much like to seek it out. Nicely done as always from an always solid brewer.",2009-10-06 00:54:54
8.5,402,118,SkullSplitter,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,STEG,4.0," Poured a nice dark brown with deep red hue. Smells malty with some brown sugar and earthy smells in the back. Taste was suprisingly good malt and darkfruit up front with some tannin and black tea in back. The after taste is just on the edge of being unpleasantly bitter but it isn't. Mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, and it is extremely drinkable which is scary considering the fact it I just saw it was 8.5. I will probably buy this again.",2009-10-06 00:55:18
4.2,28268,590,Yokel,Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier,3.0,3.5,4.5,3.5,AdmiralDiaz,4.0," Pours bright gold with a weak white head that fades quickly. Tons of bubbles flowing. Smells of very pale malt. Very smooth malt with just a bit of German hop taste, ends very bitter on the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth with a good amount of carbonation. Very drinkable and very enjoyable.",2009-10-06 00:55:56
6.9,25581,162,Ipswich Harvest Ale,American Amber / Red Ale,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,Jwale73,4.0," 12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured a hazy caramel color with a latte-like, half inch, bright white head. Thick webs of lacing are exposed as the brew recedes. Nose is fairly mild, but reveals some sweetness, as well as a hint of hops and perhaps some caramel notes. Taste consistent with nose; however, hops really comes out, almost IPA-like; however, the residual sweetness and caramel character follows with some bitterness lingering at the finish. Mouthfeel is light/medium with a slightly prickly level of carbonation on the lips and across the tongue. Pretty flavorful and sessionable. Another solid Ipswich brew.",2009-10-06 00:57:29
4.7,53108,853,Black Oak Oaktoberfest,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,northyorksammy,4.0," Very decent cask format beer, enjoyed at C'est What. Slight greyish lager, with a good head, followed by lots of lace. A light smoked malt that is quite tasty, and there is a creamy mouthfeel. Surprisingly little smoke in the nose, but cask beer has some surprisingly characteristics, and maybe it was just brewed.",2009-10-06 00:58:29

5.3,102,35,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,4.5,4.0,4.5,3.5,CAOMarcos,4.0," I enjoyed this beer poured from a bottle into a Nodic Glass. The beer poured with a rich amber hue with a thick off-white head. The beer smells of the complex mixture of malts. There is a bit of a harsh quality at first taste, but then the aftertaste has a slight hops spiciness and a defined complex sweetness that is really refreshing. Octoberfest has a lot of carbonation and you definitely feel it on the tongue. I could see myself drinking this beer very often in autumn.",2009-10-06 00:58:44
5.1,2440,296,St. Peter's Honey Porter,English Porter,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,laituegonflable,4.0," Pours a dark burgundy colour with a dusky brown tinge. Head is cream-coloured and fizzes up when moved, but mostly thin, just a bit of foam, and a bit of cloud on the top of the liquid. Seemed to have a quite thin meniscus when poured, which I loved. Looks thick, sticky and unique. Exactly what I was hoping for.		Nose is ridiculously sweet, such a rich syrupy honeycomb smell on that, blended with some mocha richness, chocolatey and honey-esque with a quite butterscotchy aroma as well, and also, I think lacqueredmouse is right - pot pourri. A lot of floral character on it. Insanely sweet, but pleasant.		More of a mustiness on the palate, along with a slight hint of a roasted malt bitterness. Floral elements with a bit of a nectar flavour on the front and back, a fair honeycomb lingering at behind the main palate throughout, and then a nice espresso bitterness on the finish, and a bit of an Irish cream flourish as well.		Mouthfeel is a bit thin, with a little creaminess from the malt being nice, but not quite enough. It's suitable but not delicious.		Overall, the burnt character is ever-so-slight off-putting from what is otherwise an incredibly tasty after-dinner beer, but not enough to detract, really. Perfect for a pairing with a nice crme brule or panna cotta.",2009-10-06 00:59:22

Appearance: Mostly clear medium brown mahogany color. Low off-white head quickly fades to a thin cap. 		Smell: Moderate malt aroma. Specifically, a nutty, chocolate, roasted malt aroma that smells like it would be perfect for this cool evening. No hops or diacetyl.		Taste: Lots of malty sweetness. Roasted malts, toffee, chocolate, and hint of licorice. Has a sweet finish that feels a little weak. Low bitterness really complements the malt.		Mouthfeel: Somewhat light-bodied, which is fine for the style, but I like my brown ales a little more robust. Minimal carbonation.		Drinkability: Mild flavor, lots of sweet malts, and low bitterness lend themselves to making this beer suitable for drinking liberally. I should have bought more than one.",2009-10-06 00:59:58

S: Apricot is very apparent - sweet and fresh. 		T: Strong apricot dominance with subtle peach flavour		M: Very light, low-medium carbonation. 		D: Easily drinkable, not to complex.

Genourous 2+ finger head (almost eggshell white) settles down but does NOT seem to dissipate. nice healthy lacing.		s: pure hoppiness. (pine?) the maltiness is mostly overwhelmed, but manages to make an appearance. 		t this comes on strong with a lot of hops, then follows up with more hoppiness. the malt backbone is there.		m I dont note the superhi alcohol content but welcome the effects nonetheless. (haha) I read someone else calling this oily and have to agree.	carbonation is a bit lite here.		d: this one, much as I love hops, I would call a bit TOO hoppy. this shortcoming will be overlooked in favor of the 9% alcohol.

5.0,6317,2541,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),Gueuze,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,Jmoore50,5.0," The top Gueuze on BA is on the shelves in my local town? Crazy son, just plain crazy. 		The appearance is a solid dark nectar lurking in a wine glass. There is a half finger white head that disappears fast, leaves no lacing. A weird thing about this one is that the edges of the brew are the exact same color as the middle. I mean this thing does not have any color variation, just a solid gold color. 		The smell is sweet sour funk. Instant mouthwatering. 		The taste is just great, I can understand why everyone who tries it would like it. The I get a raspberry-lemon-strawberry fruitiness that just sours perfectly. This is not overly done, perfect blend of three beautiful lambics. Slight lactose or wine dryness towards the end that leaves the lips smacking. Tart. 		The mouthfeel is great as is the drinkability. The mouthfeel just gets you salivating, wanting more to taste. Good drinkability, a little too sweet and tart to drink two. 	I want more, just hope that my place can get some. 		J",2009-10-06 01:00:54
5.8,6688,1623,Premium Edel (Spezialbier Edel),Dortmunder / Export Lager,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.5,TROC,4.5," After trying about 4 bottles of this beer, I can say I'm looking to buy a case of this. Smooth and drinkable. Malt is balanced nicely giving a delicious balance with the hops. A very slighty sweet hint with extreme smoothness makes this a standout. Mouthfeel is soft and full. Goes well with Bratwurst.",2009-10-06 01:03:01
6.1,53146,2372,Terrapin Pumpkinfest,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,mikesgroove,4.0," Huge, enormous fan of the style so I naturally could not wait to try and get a hold of it. When I saw it pouring that's where I was.		The pour was nice, light brown in color with a nice head of off white on top trying to balance it out. Faded evenly leaving only a touch of nice lacing down the side of the glass. Nice and rich looking though. Aroma was all at once pumpkin and all spice. Really nicely done here. Lots of things going on in here for sure. Cinnamon, Nutmeg, hints of a light hop note are all coming together quite nicely. Smooth and even flavor, just what it should be. Lots of sweet notes playing around with brown sugar and pumpkin, but at the same time it is nice and balanced without anything really jumping out at you. Nice and easy to drink, not too heavy,		Overall I was really pleased with this one. I am a big fan and to do this style right takes a bit of finesses. Quite impressed with the way they pulled this one off and I would have no issue in trying it again.",2009-10-06 01:03:01
6.2,51631,158,Hoss,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Brenden,4.0," This one is a deep copper. The head pours thick and tight, and one finger remains for some time. A tight foam remains when it dissipates, leaving spotty lacing behind.	While I'm trying to place the aroma, I remember that this is a rye. There's definitely almost a rye bread aroma that strong but subtle enough just to have the pleasant aroma without being too much. Otherwise, there's a citrus underneath with a spicy note and a gentle but nice hops and malt balance.	The flavor of the rye is the same as the aroma; a perfect blend of strong and subtle. Rich malt flavor with a hops presence that blends nicely with the rye are in the forefront with just a hint of some fruits and a spiciness. There really is an earthy note in here as well.	The mouthfeel is a pleasantly smooth one, with a light crispness in a light carbonation.	A rye Oktoberfest? Why not?",2009-10-06 01:05:07
5.0,33338,52,Buzzards Bay Altbier,Altbier,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,scoobybrew,4.0," This was poured into a stange-like glass from the bottle.		A - nice clear medium amber color with a decent thick foamy head that is well retained		S - toasted malt with a faint hop character		T - rich malt with a light roasted character and not-so-subtle noble hop finish		M - medium-to-light body, moderate carbonation		D - This is quite a nice and possibly the most authentic version this side of the big pond. It's hard to compare when it's been nearly 2 years since I was in Dusseldorf, but this does conjure those memories more so than any domestic alt in memory.",2009-10-06 01:06:33

4.5,848,57,Tecate,American Adjunct Lager,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,Florida9,2.0," Lost my detailed notes on this one. Suffice to say, this is below average beer, even by Mexican beer standards. Started off nice, with a clear yellow color and an impressive bit of head (with even more impressive retention), but that was the best of it. Smell was sweet, full of corn and grains and the taste was no better. Just more sweet corn, rice, straw, and grains in general. Lighter body with heavy carbonation.",2009-10-06 01:07:43
6.9,43905,147,Stone Cali-Belgique,Belgian IPA,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,Rudgers73,4.5," First off, I love the idea that that had for this beer. What better way to better understand beer, brewing, and different brewing methods than to do something like this. It's also a great way to teach people that might not know much about brewing and yeast and brewing conditions how specific things can completely change a beer. Ok. On to the tasting...		It looks exactly like standard stone IPA, but maybe a little bit of cloud that isn't normally there. The head is still very ""Stone"" and west coast hoppy in character. The hops still punch the nose, but there is an underlying sweetness in that Belgian yeast. Different from that sweetness that you get on the other side of those hops. This is a more round and broad sweetness that come only from Belgium (or areas very close to...) There is bubblegum hidden in the glass too. I love how much the yeast changes everything. The smell, the structure, the flavor, the mouthfeel, and the overall drinking experience. It's like your tongue wants to taste Stone IPA, but the yeast makes you forget what it tasted like. The American Ale yeast normally used in this beer works differently with the hops. It normally acts as strong object for the hops to lean on and use to exert themselves. But the Belgian yeast almost embraces the hops and wraps them up in a buffer. You can still taste the specifically bitter aspect that these hops are traditionally meant to have, but there is so much else going on before you get there, that is doesn't have the same effect. What an interesting beer. Good job Stone. ZOMG!!1",2009-10-06 01:08:05
6.8,5133,1457,Arbor Brewing Sacred Cow IPA,American IPA,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,semihobo,3.5," Was drinking this on cask at the brewery on Washington St. and liked it enough to take home a sixer. Presumably that's about as fresh as it gets in a bottle.		Dark orange and hazy, just how I like em. Nice full finger of ivory head, bubbles as small as monitor pixels.		Smell has some whole wheat toast, apricots, cream. A little bit of gingery spice hints at bitterness.		Citrusy, floral hops, about average bitterness for the style. Quite mellow. Balance between sweet/dry. There is a minor and unpleasant yeast twang on the finish that was not present in the cask version. Finish is messy, everything comes together in a generically funky/bitter way.		Medium-light, creamy mouthfeel. Finish is fairly pleasant.		This bottle wasn't quite as enjoyable for some reason, but the numbers are bumped up a bit due to the tastiness of this beer on cask and previously. Very approachable IPA, sessionable without being weak.",2009-10-06 01:11:07
6.2,53128,1114,Smokin' Amber Kegs Gone Wild,American Amber / Red Ale,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,corby112,4.5," Pours a deep dark amber/ coppery chestnut brown color with golden amber/orange edges when held to a light source and a 1.5 finger yellowish beige head with good retention, lasting throughout and leaving sporadic chunks of lacing.		Slightly earthy aroma with nice caramel malt, smokey charcoal, roasted malt, nut, barbecue, bacon with some earthy, twangy funky sour brett notes.		Sweet up front with subtle light fruit notes and a nice funky tart dry brett effervescence that lingers into the finish over a nice charcoal barbecue smokiness which provides a nice balance. This beer is very complex and well balanced. A unique blend of two of my favorite styles. Recommended.",2009-10-06 01:12:01
6.5,31748,42,BiÃ¨re De Mars,BiÃ¨re de Garde,4.0,4.5,3.5,3.5,sociallooter,3.5," This beer I'm drinking now! My first review while actually drinking the beer at the same time. My friend turned me on to this strange beer. Honestly a true traditional beer style, although the term ""Bire De Mars"" seems to be a new ""type"" for me. I'm totally convinced that this could be a landmark in tasting beer for me. It has such a strange taste. I have tasted this funk in beer many times before but as this beer warms up it becomes insane with yeasty cow shit funk smell. I kinda like it. Every other reviews on this page does not address this matter nearly at all. I hear of mango, pear, apple, citrus and black pepper. I can sometimes taste these things. I really feel that the suspended Brett chunks reminds me of old apple cider vinegar with little tornadoes of nasty swirling around and around.		This beer is cool...rare vos is very similar just without the extra funk. At least try it once..it costs a lot but money is common and this not so much.",2009-10-06 01:13:39
5.2,53130,1114,El Hefe Dunkle Gone Wild,Dunkelweizen,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,corby112,3.0," Pours a very deep, dark chestnut brown which is almost completely opaque with only the slightest dark mahogany edges when held to a light source and a one finger light beige head that quickly fades into a thin cap with decent retention. Not much lacing.		Sweet caramel malt aroma with hints of chocolate and toffee notes with a prominent funky brett presence.		Sweet, dry funky brett up front that provides a nice sour puckering feel without being too acidic. Very sharp and dry. This flavor is very prominent and overshadows the other flavors. If I tasted this blind I would never know it was wheat based. The bready yeast, caramel malt and toffee notes are very subtle and as mentioned above are completely overpowered by the dry funky brett. Very dry finish that is slightly puckering.		This was an interesting concept but turned out to be very one dimensional",2009-10-06 01:13:42
4.9,104,35,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,Vienna Lager,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.5,EsoxLucius,4.0," Poured from a 355ml bottle.		I normally can't get this beer and have to go to the border cities along the SK/AB line to find it. When i'm thru town i always pick up a case of this brew as it's a nice change of pace and it's a quality product that i enjoy.		A - It pours a golden-orange color with a white fluffy head that went away fairly fast. it does leave some lacing around throughout the entire drink.		S - It's not an overpowering smell, some malt smell does become pronounced after a good sniff along with some hop bitterness.		T - better than it smells, it has some bitterness from the hops, but there is the sweetness/carmel taste of the malt that makes this beer very enjoyable.		M - gets better through the taste, initally thin, thickens up nicely and goes down smooth.		D - good taste with a solid feel makes this beer go down quite well.",2009-10-06 01:14:15
6.5,18272,1141,DerniÃ¨re VolontÃ©,Belgian Pale Ale,4.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,bashiba,3.0," Poured a cloudy Yellow orange with a very thick and creamy off white head leaving a spiderweb of bubbly lacing down the side of the glass.		The smell is very yeasty with a light sweet tropical fruit odor.		The flavors are very subtle with a light caramel malt base and a light dry spicyness, sort of on the bland side.		The mouthfeel is light and creamy with a long lasting dry finish.		Overall this is a bit mediocre without nothing really standing out.",2009-10-06 01:14:24

Nice florl hop aroma with some resinous dank hop oils, citrus peel, grapefruit, slight pine, subtle alcohol and a caramel malt backbone.		Chewy resinous mouthfeel with a bitter earthy hop blast up front with some nice floral notes. Very dry with a very chewy, piny presence with some dank hop resin, lemon peel and grapefruit. There is also a nice caramel malt backbone that provides a nice balance to the extremely dry bitter pine hops without taking away from those flavors. Very good!",2009-10-06 01:15:22
5.3,102,35,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,2.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,PintOHops,3.5," Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.		Appearance/Smell - Appeared a clear dark amber color, it produced a pretty poor head, equally poor retention, and the lacing isn't worth mentioning. Little carbonation could be seen, almost looked flat minutes after pouring. Smelled of soft, but tart, fruity grape/raisin, following is a dominate malt aroma, very grainy & biscuit like with soft caramel and moderately sweet smelling.		Taste/Mouthfeel - Tasted of a bit of citrus as it hits the tongue, then a not so rich but dominate flavor profile of caramel, molasses, and biscuit. Very one noted and not complex flavor profile at all, hardly any hop bitterness noticeable, but just enough for decent balance. All flavors seem to linger a bit on the tongue. Mouthfeel was lightly crisp, then sorta heavy and a bit silky, would have enjoyed a bit more carbonation here. Around full bodied.		Drinkability/Final thoughts - This is an outstandingly session able brew! One could drink 3-4 of these beers and enjoy everyone of them, things I didn't like about it where the appearance and the overall taste. The appearance was lacking horribly as noted above, and there just wasn't any complexity to the taste, it just hits you with an instant flavor of caramel/molasses/biscuit. I thought this Octoberfest was decent but I know there are better, still wasn't bad, and I did enjoy it, so if it's all you can get it's still pretty good.		Cheers and happy Octoberfest!",2009-10-06 01:15:28

Pours pitch black and completely opaque with only the slightest hint of mahogany in the edges when held to a light source and a two finger light beige head that has great retention, slowly fading into a lasting ring that leaves chunky rings of lacing.		Sweet roasted malt aroma with chocolate malt, toffee, caramel and a nice smokiness on the end with subtle chocolate.

5.0,52102,491,62 Pilsner,German Pilsener,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,laituegonflable,2.0," Pours a pale champagne appearance, golden in colour with extreme effervescence throughout. Bead is powerful and thick, fedding a moderately thick head of white foam that sinks slowly from the top, leaving a few patches of lace. Looks pilsenery, but not sensational.		Nose is moderately phenolic, and almost vinous, with a light tart edge and a fruity boozey character just tickling the senses. Hops are quite prevalent, lightly floral and almost piney, with an autumnal kind of smell of dried leaves and resin. Doesn't have an enormous amount of aroma, but what's there is quite enjoyable.		Taste is a mlange of bitter with little in the way of maltiness, or anything else. Lightly phenolic alcohol, vinously tart and with a hint of lychee on the front, then descends into a long, resiny bitterness that becomes more aggressively bitter as it profresses, resulting in a small abyss of puckering hoppiness. I'm not entirely sure but knowing Coopers I suspect it's hopped with predominantly POR which just doesn't suit the pilsener profile. There is nothing floral about the hops, and the finish almost tastes stale.		The dankness of the bitter taste is such that is spoils any real 'refreshment' and the palate is completely without nuance, just a bombardment of bitterness, like having a conversation with Gore Vidal about his loving relationship with Truman Capote.		The mouthfeel is quite tingly from the strong carbonation, although a little sticky, which doesn't sit quite right with the bitter flavour.		Although the Pride of Ringworm is used more interestingly here than in most Australian piss, its mostly unpleasant flavour reminds one why the variety is such a stigma of the Australian beer scene. It doesn't fail to make what might have been an OK beer quite distasteful.",2009-10-06 01:16:52
6.5,18272,1141,DerniÃ¨re VolontÃ©,Belgian Pale Ale,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,Blakaeris,3.5," Pours hazy pale golden with a thick, creamy head that leaves sheets of sticky lacing.		Aroma is caramel malt and citrus fruit. Vague yeasty spices have an herbal quality.		Taste is initially sweet with pale and caramel malt and Belgian candy sugar. Fruity with lemon, pineapple and grapefruit. Finish is sweet with a definite floral quality and vague yeasty spices.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied, generously carbonated to be soft and smooth.

A= Like a slightly off-pink blush bubbling wine. No head. Looks like the stuff we used to make in college and called it ""balloon wine.""		S= Interesting scents of red florals (cherry, strawberry, raspberry etc) and hibiscus or rose-hips. Smells like the stuff we used to make in college and called it ""balloon wine.""		T= Lightly bubbly, half-fermented red-fruit and hibiscus (or rose-hips) flavors. Tastes like the stuff we used to make in college and called it ""balloon wine.""		M= Mildly yeasty like half-finished balloon wine. Not bad, although my wife nearly choked on it. I was hoping for a far more enjoyable experience from this especially at $4.99 for a single bottle. The bottle artwork was the redeeming trait.		D= We half-finished a 12-ounce bottle between 2 adults. I let the remainder go flat overnight and today there's hardly any flavor in the remaining off-pink liquid-- more like very watered-down cheap wine rinse or similar. Oddly though, there's a lot more scent and nose in the flat fluid remaining than any sort of flavor or taste.",2009-10-06 01:17:50

8.0,1792,73,Great Lakes Nosferatu,American Strong Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,littlekidlover,4.0," poured my bottle of Nosferatu into my beer tasting wine glass. The appearence is a very interesting red. Nice off white head with decent retention and lacing. The aroma is hop forward with evidence of well rounded malt. The taste is difficult to distinguish in my memory from Great Lake's Burning River, but there is more warming alcohol. Theres some citrus hops, some smooth rounded slightly caramel malt. Nice medium body, coats the tongue with a bit of lingering bitterness. This could be a wild one, with it's high alcohol and relative easy drinkability you're gonna need a ride home.",2009-10-06 01:18:50

T: All malt here. This is extremely interesting. I'm not sure if I'm drinking a chocolate latte or a beer.		M: N/A to me.		D: Not even close to being a drinkable beer.

5.0,38448,194,St-Ambroise Citrouille (Pumpkin Ale),Pumpkin Ale,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,MeisterBurger,3.0," Pours a lovely medium amber with a bubbly head, lots of carbonation and a respectable amount of retention throughout.		It smells like pumpkin pie spice with a mild dose of caramel. Very nice. Ginger, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg are all at play. Smells like ginger beer poured over pot potpourri. 		The taste is a mix of beer and ginger beer, as the ginger aspect is surprisingly prevalent at first, but the nutmeg and cinnamon and allspice soon come into play. Very clean flavors, but at the same time maybe a little TOO punchy. A mildly bready caramel malt is in good balance with the hop bitterness, but overall the brashness of the spicing almost makes you forget it's a beer. I don't really taste pumpkin. Cooked pumpkin on its own is such a subtle flavor I can't see how it could ever be detectable in a beer once it's added to water, malted barley, hops, water, mind alongside this much spice. But if other people can taste it then I have to assume the failing is unique to me.		The mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation a little sharp.		I kind of like it but I don't love and I agree with patpat444 in that it has a certain aspect of tasting artificial, mass produced almost, and not something that was lovingly crafted. The spices add a nice dimension to the aroma, but they seem to dominate the taste.",2009-10-06 01:21:38

It's great clarity allows a surprising amount of light in, creating a glowing beacon of an ale. It's accented by a ring of bone colored head - and that's about it. This is a beer that leaves filmy legs on the glass as opposed to lacing. 		Ample brown sugar in the nose, heats into some vanilla extract. finished by pleasantly crisped toast, salt water taffy... and all glazed over a base of almond nuttiness.		This beer is chewy up front... it opens right up into a huge sweet presence that fills the mouth, more specifically we pick up caramalized almonds, a bit of honey and candied oranges. It arcs with some herbal sharpness then spreads and softens in the finish with a massive dose of of caramel that grows into roasted territory. A wallop of sugary malt from start to finish...The nice surprise is that it finishes juuust crisp enough that some 'dryness' enters the picture. The sweetness doesn't coat much, but instead leaves echoes at the top of my mouth. A good beer to drink on a lazy fall evening.",2009-10-06 01:22:08
5.93,2870,741,Fuel Cafe (Coffee Flavored Stout),American Stout,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,Goldfish19,2.5," ~ Purchased this 12 oz bottle from New Beer Distributors in Manhattan, NY. This beer pours black with a healthy tan head that diminishes quickly. The aroma I get out of this is chocolate, followed by hints of coffee and roasted malts. Taste is slightly sourish, and I did not really pick out any of the coffee. For a stout, the body is a little on the thin side. Overall, this is an interesting beer (interesting in a weird sort of way). Thank God for the Mix-a-Six! ~",2009-10-06 01:23:04

T - Such a unique taste...but maybe that's because I've been drinking too many double IPA's lately! :) I like it!

I think either would be a good choice, I don't regret my choice. Pours a thick dark brown/black color that gets slightly lighter on the sides. A chocolate milk colored head that goes away fairly quickly, but it has some ok lacing to the glass. Smell is nice, dominated by what smells like a few different types of chocolate, mostly strong and bitter types. The taste is quite good. Some roasted malts to add to the different chocolate type flavors. Doesn't taste too bitter, has a sweet flavor to it as well, would be the perfect dessert beer. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. It's very thick, might be a little too sweet if you weren't expecting it. The drinkablility is very nice eventhough it's very thick. I really enjoyed this beer but I'd recommend it really as a dessert beer only, it's so sweet that it's really tough to think of it in any other way. Still a very solid brew by Southern Tier",2009-10-06 01:24:18

A. the highlight! it looks like a beer, though a pale yellow one. heaps of fizz, thin white head.		S: artificial lime, like lime kool-aid was added. not impressed.		T: the worst, a metalic-candy lime with only the faintest hint of there being beer involved. the beer that is doesn't impress and the overpowering fake lime taste made me not make it through this one without chasing it.		M: thin, like most light beers, left nothing to desire or to open another can. 		D: i'm not impressed, but some friends gave it to their ladies and they downed them last weekend,they were already tanked and probably couldn't tell if it was good or bad.		conclusion: it's cheap and came with a hat on a 6 pack and the hat is a good hat.

I love the bottle, it looks like a mini 40 oz. from the middle ages. 		Smells and looks like Orval. Elements of Bam Biere and Burton Bridge Empire IPA...enough comparisons though, it must be a similar strain of Brett taking hold. 		Pours a hazy orange gold, a fluffy compact head settles into a patchy ring after quite a while. Stellar aroma of wildflowers, musty attic, and funky fruit. Deeper whiffs/swirls bring on some cheese rind and restrained horsey funkiness. Flavor is dry and Brett dominated. Somewhat medicinal, very dry with a flash of Maris Otter malt in the middle, buried under the yeast complexity. Aftertaste has a resiny hop earthiness. Effervescent yet full bodied, again like Orval. If you aren't a fan of wild ales stay away, although it's fairly restrained with the funk, and masterfully balanced. This is a fascinating and easily drinkable beer, here's to Dan Carey and his experimental projects...can't wait to see what happens next in the R&D series.",2009-10-06 01:32:16

Not much in the way of lacing.		Spicy aroma with a lot of crisp light fruit notes. Not as earthy as I expected with hints of apple, cherry, berry, pear, pepper and bread. Not skunky or earthy as many of their other beers and saisons in general seem to be.		This beer has a very complex flavor, especially when it warms up properly. Very crisp medium body with a decent amount of bready yeast in the mouthfeel and a lot of crisp light fruit notes. Apple and pear come to mind but there is also a very nice berry, especially strawberry presence as ell as some sweet cherry. In addition to the sweet fruit notes from the Belgian yeast strain there is a slight peppery sweetness and a very subtle medicinal note.

A medium size head forms on pour and mostly retains with some stick to the glass.		S - A nice blend of some citrus fruit - strong aromas of lemon zest, grapefruit, and orange give this brew an alluring smell. 		T - More piny than citrus up front with some mild bitterness. Balanced with some grainy malt flavor, but the malt presence dominates the flavor, even though it is not overstated. The finish reveals the citrus flavors from the smell. Not bad, but fairly pedestrian within the style. 		M - Crisp flavor and medium/full bodied with a great dry finish. The lingering citrus flavor lends a somewhat unpleasant sticky and syrupy quality.

Not absolutely clear, but fairly clear. Smells of carmel and hop. Taste is sweet at first, then turns very bitter. No pine taste like the usual hoppy beer, just bitterness. The sweet and bitter balance perfectly. To be honest, I wasn't really looking forward to trying this one, but I'm very glad I did. By far the best Red I've ever had.

Great taste, with some hoppy citrus, some various malt flavors, and of course the requisite biscuit flavor that New Belgium is known for.

The smell, I think, was the best smell of any beer I have ever reviewed. Very sweet, with hints of ginger cookies, or pumpkin pie. Very nostalgic of childhood, and the Fall.		The taste was very good. Strong bite of carbonation and hops, giving way to sweet pumpkin and sugar flavors. Very well blended and balanced taste.

A- Perfect dark brown beer, very dark, can barely see any light pass through this big, dark beer. A soft bed of foam sits on top, thick and bubbly, and very appetizing.		S- Sweet roasted malt and grains in the nose, but backed with coffee, bread, vanilla and a nice smokiness.		T- Again, strong sweet malts, balanced completely with SN's trademark hops character. An absolutely amazing beer; this is THE American porter, perfectly crafted to make a terrific session brew that is complex without becoming overbearing and overwrought. Perfect taste, perfect balance, perfect perfect perfect. 		M- A big mouthful of a beer, but without being heavy, and the bold mouthfeel quickly subsides to a silky smooth finish that makes you want to take a big gulp and do it all over again. Medium carbonation, paired with a full body make for one amazing beer.		D- Again, perfection in a glass. This is one of a very few porters that I could keep drinking after the first. Not that I don't like porters, but this one is exceptionally drinkable.		*My first perfect score! And this after I thought I'd never find a Sierra Nevada beer that I liked.

As a pale lager it's not bad, not great, but not bad. As a fest, it's the requisite malty, easy drinking beer. But the key red/Vienna malt thing is ignored. Oh well. Served with a nice, white, foamy, frothy head and lots of lace. Color is a clear yellow gold. Aroma is a very mild malt. Flavor show's a lot more hop (fest?) bitterness and good balance with the malt, so I have some decent bittersweet flav. Body is quite good and so is carbonation. Finish is quintessential pale lager.

Also, Saskatoon based Paddockwood needs to bring their IPA back into production!		this is not a real IPA in my mind, it's weak, very weak with only the faintest of hints of being an IPA.

I went and visited the brewery and was completely excited to get some brewery fresh beer until I tried this. Very disappointing.		A: Pours pale, straw yellow with very little head.		S: almost overproduced, there was zero hints of the fruity tones found in other IPA's i've tried. slightly metalic/bitter smell.		T: the taste was thin, there was a cornish taste to it mixed in with the faintest of hop. eesh.		M: medium carbonation and feel is not bad.

Slight grass funk with some straw but the peach really shines through without seeming syrupy or cloyingly sweet.		This is surprisingly very full bodied with a MASSIVE amount of sweet cirsp peach flavor that dominates throughout. The body is creamy and there are some funky tart earthy notes as ell as some peppery spice that provide a nice touch but this beer is all peach. Even though the peach flavor dominates, it is a very organic natural flavor and has none of the artificial syrupy sweetness that generally is found in fruit beers. The ABV is completely undetectable, making this beer extremely drinkable. I highly recommend this to fans of New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart.",2009-10-06 01:43:03
6.5,26380,10321,Red Racer ESB,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,stagger,5.0," On-tap at the Alibi Room, as part of a three-round face-off between a number of different draft selections there. 		In three rounds of four beers each, the ESB clearly came out on top, ahead of perennial favourites such as Red Racer IPA and Driftwood Farmhand. A well-rounded, extraordinarily favourful and balanced bitter, equally suited for savouring and sessioning. As fine as their IPA is, it pales (no pun intended) in comparison to the ESB. 		If they can get this into bottles (correction: cans, I suppose) I'd drive across the border regularly to get my fix. Well done, Central City!",2009-10-06 01:43:09
5.0,1654,455,Creemore Springs Premium Lager,American Amber / Red Lager,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,ecoastman,4.0, Drinkability - Very drinkable and I think I prefer this over most lagers (including the macro Euro lagers that this beer has to compete with in our Ontario stores). This score is for the can but I think the draft is even better.		Appearance - A clear dark gold that appears to pour thick when cold. A medium head that recedes quickly but maintains a thin layer through good carbonation. Some lacing.		Smell - Clean sweet malt with bread. Very light on the hops.		Taste - Nice malty start leading into light diactyl butterscotch notes. Finishes with very faint earthy hops and low bitterness. A good product for this style which generally doesn't get much respect. 		Mouthfeel - smooth and lightly creamy. The diacetyl provides some slickness into the finish. A nice medium level of carbonation.,2009-10-06 01:43:19
5.0,2270,721,Carlsberg Beer,Euro Pale Lager,3.5,2.5,3.0,4.0,MeisterBurger,3.0," I'm reviewing a Carlsberg? Oh God! Have I hit rock bottom?		What can I say? I'm bored. And it was free. So here goes.		The can says probably the best beer in the world. Probably? They keep using that word. I don't think it means what they think it means. 		Pours a clear golden color with a bucketload of carbonation. A 1/4"" head retains nicely.		It has that typically floral Euro lager aroma that I, for one, am not a fan of. A little grassy, a lot floral.		The taste is biscuity pale malt. Light bitterness. Soapy floral hops. 		The mouthfeel is medium, surprisingly so for this kind of beer. Good carbonation.		I can't say as I love this beer but for what it is and if faced with other macro type Euro options, I would probably reach for this over many others of its ilk. I only hope this never happens.",2009-10-06 01:44:41

Smells of thick dark chocolates and coffee.		Tastes the same as it smells and its very smooth. It has a bit of roasted malt tanginess as well. Its very well balanced.		Mouthfeel is a bit on the medium bodied side. Its also very nice and creamy.		I throughly enjoyed this one. Glad its always available at my local stop!,2009-10-06 01:49:37
6.7,52371,140,Sierra Nevada Estate Brewers Harvest Ale,American IPA,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,ArrogantB,3.0," Nice orange color with a good head that laces the glass, looks a lot like the chico estate from last year or the regular harvest beer they put out annually. The smell is off-putting at first, burned plastic that then becomes kind of malty. The taste is also quite underwhelming with just a bit of grassy hoppiness. This is not a bad beer its just sort of boring to me for some reason although I felt the same way about the Chico estate and the Southern Hemisphere.",2009-10-06 01:51:24

To me, this is ""BEER"" as generic as possible... nothing flashy, but you could do a lot worse. 12oz can into wide snifter. 		A- paler yellow than I thought possible. Not appealing in the least, although not too much lighter than your standard Am. Ad. Lager. 		S- Corn? Malt? Grain? Sweetness. As inoffensive as you can get. 		T- Like seltzer water. Seriously. Mild grain... and that's about it. Nothing in this beer wows me.. except for the drinkability. 		M- Crisp, good carbonation.		D- Insanely high. I can drink like 15 of these and still be up for one more. Of course, I haven't since high school.		Easy to drink, this is The King Of Beers like McDonalds is the King Of Food.

S - wheat bread and caramel/toffee smelling malts compliment the typical hefe scents of 'nana and clove. i also pick up on some apple and biscuity yeast.		T - what I expected, tastes of spiced banana bread. sweet and well rounded flavor that stays consistent throughout. I'm starting to find dunkels more satisfying than their little lighter brothers. Perhaps it's the darker malts that give it more character.		MF - tingly from tons of carbonation. this is a well bodied beverage, not huge, but certainly fuller than most wheats.		D - highly drinkable and thirst quenching. great amount of flavor for something clocking in at under 6 percent. only thing better than a solid Bavarian unfiltered wheat, is a dark Bavarian unfiltered wheat. ...and maybe a oatmeal raisin cookie to go with it. :)",2009-10-06 01:54:56

The brewer told me they have had to toss at least one cask of porter in the past, so I can understand some wide variance in recipes and process from what is served. It was very wine like, and strong tannins at that! And the wine that you have around in your fridge longer than you should and its becoming vinegarish. No carbonation itself. Reddish black. I do believe wine was added. Vinegar aroma.",2009-10-06 01:55:37

Them places is invaluable to us stuck in the middle of the country who can't get any of Deschutes precious brews. 		Very curious to see how this stacks up to the XX - comparisons are inevitable in my tiny little brain since the XX was so damn good. Had one of these just after it came out & it still seemed muddled, but couldn't wait any longer to see what it's up to. Three months should be enough!		Poured during the infamous Monday Night Football game, Favre vs. the Packers. It's black, a nice shade, kind of dark. Tan head. Easy on the nose, bourbon & coffee come out on top. 		Black Butte XXI hasn't quite lived up to its predecessor yet, but getting close. The flavors are starting to play together politely: bourbon, chocolate, coffee, dark malts, all present, nothing shouting for attention, but everything goood. 		Starts out thin on the pour, this one needs to warm up before smell, mouthfeel, & taste hit their peak, even more so than most brews. Like XX, drinkability is a strong point. Because this isn't over-bourboned, over-coffeed, etc. I could drink a bomber or more of this while sitting around with my hand in my boxers. 		Excellent beer. I think it can get better. Not going to break open another bottle until at least the new year. Might reach A or A+ level by that time. Eager to find out!",2009-10-06 01:57:08
9.0,52007,10097,Harpoon Leviathan - Saison Royale,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.0,2.0,1.5,3.0,philipquarles,1.5," 12oz bottle. Pours a very nice cloudy dark yellow with a huge white head that lasts. Leaves good lacing. Smells absurdly over-spiced. Ginger and a lot of pepper. There's a bit of sweet malt, but it's mostly masked. The taste is also dominated by egregious amounts of spice. Very sweet with a bit of alcohol. Some stange flavors remiscent of soap (though I'm certain it's not--I only use hot water to clean my glasses). Sweet finish. Slightly syrupy body. This is essentially everything a saison shouldn't be. Spiced (into oblivion), incredibly sweet, and huge alcohol. Pretty terrible. Went down the drain.",2009-10-06 01:58:53
7.0,38149,18149,Cable Car,American Wild Ale,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,corby112,5.0," Big thanks go out to FooFaa for busting this out at a recent tasting. I've wanted to try this beer for a very long time so I was really psyched to try it. Thanks a bunch Dan!		Pours a dark golden ripe banana color that is slightly murky with a one finger off-white head that quickly fades into a lasting ring. There is very minimal lacing, only small spots here and there.		Very funky aroma with some nice barnyard, horseblankety goodness. Lots of crisp golden fruits, apple, pear, grape, etc and a nice dusty earthy oak character. Just the smell of this beer made my mouth water. I literally sniffed my glass for several minutes before even taking a sip.		This beer has a perfect balance of intense puckering tart barnyard funk, horseblanket notes, slightly lactic and acidic but not too much so. Tart and sour intensity up front that settles into some beautiful light crisp golden fruit notes. Hints of apple, pear, grapefruit, light grape followed by more funky brett oaky sourness which lingers into the amazing mouthwatering finish. Very dry yet sweet and crisp with an amazing crisp dry tart puckering finish. 		This is an amazing beer that for me truly lived up to the hype. It is just a perfect blend of tart/puckering sourness, crisp delicious fruit notes and a dry sweet yet tart delectable finish. This beer tasted better with each sip and my mouth was literally watering in anticipation of each sip. This is one of the most complex, flavorful sours I've ever had and I cannot recommend it any higher. I only wish I had more.",2009-10-06 02:00:34

T - thin on real flavor, fat on spice. not a violating or bad flavor by any means, just thin, watered down, 1 dimensional and uninspired. Basically all I get is a yeasty flavor w/ some nutmeg and allspice, not much else happening here.		MF - thin, light to almost medium body, moderate carb, nothing special.		D - this beer is very approachable if you are just looking for something to quaff. the thin body and smooth, crisp feel are perfect for haveing several. that said, the flavor sucked, and I could not finish the bottle with the flavor being my number one goal. again, if your just looking for a thirst quencher, this brew ain't all that bad. if you want something more -avoid!",2009-10-06 02:02:53

Definite charred, roasted notes on the taste with cocoa and even French roast coffee making an appearance. The appearance is dark, opaque and alluring.

5.0,23627,218,De Koninck Amber,Flanders Red Ale,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,BEERchitect,3.5," A standard Flanders Red that shows moderate traits of vineous, woodsiness, grapes, cherries, and red wines. A fairly still look later allows the lacking carbonation to play too thin and dull on the palate. Solid browns show some hazy red highlights. Malt taste balances beer maybe too much.

7.3,22505,2743,Green Flash West Coast I.P.A.,American IPA,4.0,4.5,5.0,4.5,itsagoodpicture,4.5," This is an interesting take on a stronger single IPA. The smell right out of the bottle is of Centennial hops, but the taste is much more balanced in terms of the total hop variety. I was hardly able to detect any malts, which is a pretty good accomplishment for a single IPA. There is some initial hop bite on the tongue, but it dissipates rather rapidly. Not much aftertaste to speak of, this one really doesn't seem to linger, which to many would likely increase drinkability. Fair enough. Overall, decent suds.",2009-10-06 02:13:12

Light khaki head, showing some retentive powers and then going to a thick collar/film and respectable sliding lace. Bright malty nose, with a hay like quality to it.

5.5,51761,590,Unplugged Old English Porter,English Porter,3.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,KarlHungus,4.5," This beer pours a clear tawny color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into a thin cap of lacing. The aroma is sour with some nice nuttiness. The taste is nuttier, and maltier than the aroma. There is still a nice sourness. Good complexity. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, as a fan of both porters and sours, I really appreciate this beer. This is the first time I have had the pleasure of tasting what could be considered an authentic old porter. I am a lukewarm New Glarus fan, but I would really like to have this beer available to me on a regular basis.",2009-10-06 02:13:41
5.0,83,32,Beck's Oktoberfest,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,drpimento,3.0," *Sigh* The best Okfest beers this year have, at best, a little malt chewiness, and none of that essential Vienna malt roastiness that, with the other ingredients make this such a session beer style. Served with a decent, off-white head, and a bit of lace. Color is a reddish amber. Aroma is malty and a little caramel. Flavor is malty, a hint of bitterness, a bit of toffee. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like the rest of it, ok, not bad, better than the other 2/3rds of them. Could be a session I suppose.",2009-10-06 02:13:46
4.1,35735,105,Miller Chill,Light Lager,1.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,TheManiacalOne,2.5," Poured from a 12oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.		A: The beer is a pale and almost clear yellow color, with a short white head that fades very quickly and leaves a very spotty lace on the glass.		S: The aroma is of adjuncts, lime juice and very light malts.		T: The taste isn't too bad considering what it is intended to be. It's essentially your common light beer with twist of lime. The citric lime flavor tempers the usual macro sweetness. There's almost no hops flavor and the malt character is extremely thin. The after-taste is slightly tart.		M: Crisp and a little smooth, very light body, medium-to-high carbonation, finish is clean.		D: A little flavorful, goes down easily and is not too filling since there isn't much of anything to this beer other than the lime flavor, very mild kick, for those that drink the macros regularly this is a good beer to try for something light and different, but overall it's a beer that tries not to taste like beer.",2009-10-06 02:14:01
,31887,20058,Arch Ale,American Amber / Red Ale,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,Matthoc116,2.0," Like most of the reviewers, I was enticed by the Hartford Arch on the label expecting a local brewery. But I'll review this as a beer, not as a brewery.		Poured a very thin, nice amber color. No head or lacing present. Immediately smells of dicetyl, with a whiff of malt on the backend; not pleasant. Little hop aroma, and any that would be present is overpowered by a strong vegetable odor.		Tastes much like it smells. Think Bass Ale with strong cauliflower notes. Maybe I got a bad batch, but looking at the other reviews I'm not willing to give the benefit of the doubt. Sad that the city and the Arch had to be associated with this bottle.",2009-10-06 02:14:15
6.0,39096,2216,Drie Fonteinen Hommage,Lambic - Fruit,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,corby112,4.5," Pours a deep dark ruby red color with dark mahogany edges and a slightly pinkish one finger fizzy head that quickly fades into a lasting ring and some visible carbonation bubbles. 		Barnyard funk aroma that is very earthy with some ashy oaky wood. The raspberries have faded a bit by this point and there is a somewhat scorched earth, moldy musty character. The fruit is there although it seems concentrated and I could swear that I could even smell the seeds.		Extremely tart, sour and funky. Very puckering and lip smacking while only mildly acidic. Lots of sweet dry raspberry buried beneath the barnyard lactic funkiness. As in the aroma, the raspberries have faded but they are still evident. This beer is intensely sour but is somewhat balanced by the sweetness of the berries. There is also some earthy oak and vanilla notes and a very sour puckering dry acidity with some more acidity coming through. The burnt ashy wood character from the aroma comes through a bit. 		I can't believe how sour this beer has become with the aging. I wish I could have tried this fresh to see how prominent the berries were. Either way this beer is very complex with lots of delicious flavors bouncing off of one another. I picked something else up with each sip. I'm not the biggest fan of raspberry beers or raspberries for that matter but this beer was very impressive. All sour heads should seek this one out.",2009-10-06 02:14:51

A: The beer is a very pale yellow color, with a thin white head that fades very quickly and leaves very little lace on the glass.		S: The aroma is very faint but contains adjuncts, light malts, grain and a very faint touch of hops.		T: The taste mainly consists of the typical adjunct sweetness along with bready flavors of grain and a light malt character. The hops presence is very mild even for the style. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly bready.		M: Crisp and a little smooth, light body, medium-to-high carbonation, finish is clean.		D: Not very flavorful, goes down easily and is not too filling since there isn't much to this beer, mild kick, not really sure what difference the ""DryBrew"" process makes since it seems like just another fizzy yellow beer from A-B.",2009-10-06 02:14:59
9.0,1407,489,Columbus,Belgian Pale Ale,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,emerge077,4.0," Clean pour in to a Duvel tulip, it was bright golden orange save for a few random suspended bits. Giant sticky head, ala Orval or Duvel. A little gunsmoke once the cap came off, and the odd smell of warm corn tortillas. Very yeasty now, a candy-like shortbread cookie dominates the aroma. Brett is present, some wet hay and vegetal flavors in the aftertaste. Soapy, sticky foam that lasts for a good 20 minutes. Fruity, medicinal flavors, this bottle obviously cellared long enough for the Brett to come out. Some dried currant and apricot notes, clover, grass, and honey/maple syrup. 		Seems almost like an aged Tripel at this point. A little odd, I remember it being sweeter and richer than this. Oh well that's what I get for cellaring it for a year+",2009-10-06 02:15:16
6.6,2137,470,Leffe Blonde,Belgian Pale Ale,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,mdwalsh,3.5," A: A pale straw to golden color, very clear with some active carbonation. A fluffy white head that's fading pretty quick, but not as fast as some.		S: Fruit and Belgiannyness. Candi Sugar. A very simple, straight forward Belgian Ale, not really a pale ale though.		T: Very similar to the smell, more earthy than fruity though. Still a pretty straight forward Belgian taste.		M: Almost syrupy. No carbonation.		D: Meeehhh, try as I might, I can't get into Belgians. I think this would be a pretty good session beer for someone who was.",2009-10-06 02:15:23
5.5,772,76,Hacker-Pschorr Hefe Weisse NatÃ¼rtrub,Hefeweizen,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,TheManiacalOne,4.5," Poured from a 12oz bottle into a weizen glass.		A: The beer is a cloudy light gold color, with a large white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.		S: The aroma is of wheat, bananas, light malts, hints of lemon & spice and a faint touch of hops.		T: The taste starts with bready flavors of wheat and a hearty malt character. Then some sweet and complementary flavors of bananas, spices and citrus come in. The hops presence is mild but on-target for the style and provides a good balance. The after-taste is slightly bready and slightly sweet.		M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.		D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is beer has everything that you look for in a Hefeweizen and is a very good beer to drink for a long time.",2009-10-06 02:16:01

4.6,5328,579,Longboard Island Lager,American Pale Lager,4.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,crossovert,3.5," Really needed something refreshing tonight and saw this. Hopefully it is somewhat good.		Pours with a bright 3 finger white head, and a light pale yellow. Good for the style.		Semll is grainy, with some kisses of hops. Typical astingency of an American light lager.		Taste is very malty and bready, with some metallic character, surprisingly heavier than expected but it is pretty light bodied despite that. Hops are there, they are very medicinal and earthy with a tiny pinch of pine.		It just wasn't refreshing enough to be something worth purchasing perhaps it is the sweetness or not enough carbonation. The hops are tasty but they cold be stronger and have this more pilsener-like.		Overall is is better than a lot of American light lagers, but like most it ""pales"" in comparison to its European brethren.",2009-10-06 02:17:18

A -- A light, hazy, cloudy amber / red color with a nice head that dissipates well but not too quickly.		S -- Obvious notes of sour tart fruit and the slightly pungent scent of the wild stuff. Not overly fragrant without sticking your nose right in it. Light hop notes linger.		T -- The fruit flavor is present but not forefront. The tartness carries in this beer and gives a nice pucker and has a long lasting aftertaste. A good funk grabs and holds on.		M -- Dry, semi-low carbonation makes it so that the tartness and the low sweetness don't shred your tastebuds. After a few minutes, it seems as though you may have had a mouthful of sunflower seeds or Sour Patch Kids -- a little numbing.		D -- I haven't ventured into the realm of many wild beers yet, but I think this one makes a good solid approachable beer for those looking to expand and expound. I don't know if I'll spend the money on another without special cause but I'm glad I tried it.",2009-10-06 02:17:43
6.6,12719,10272,Innis And Gunn Oak Aged Beer,Scottish Ale,3.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,ludachris,4.0," Pours a clear, deep honey brown hue with less than a finger of white, foamy head. No retention and minimal lacing.		Deep smell of toffee, caramel, buttered bread, sweet malts, oak, whisky, vanilla, light fruity esters, grassy hops and a bit of skunk. 		All the sweet flavours upfront, toffee, buttery malts and whisky being the most pronounced followed by a a crisp, light grassy hop finish. 6.6 ABV is well hidden.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy; very similar to their lightly oaked version. Excellent balance and a joy to drink.		Overall, this is my favorite version of the 3 Innis and Gunn's I've had. Rich creamy mouthfeel of the lightly oaked version paired with a wonderful complex smell and taste the Canada Day Anniversery seemed to lack. At approximately $3.50 a bottle, this is a beer for me to be enjoyed more modestly, but that won't stop me from buying another one down the road.",2009-10-06 02:18:12
4.7,6135,703,Erdinger Champ,Hefeweizen,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,TheManiacalOne,3.0," Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.		A: The beer is a cloudy gold color, with a thin white head that fades quickly and leaves a very thin lace on the glass.		S: The aroma is faint but contains wheat, bananas, light malts, some spice and a faint touch of hops.		T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of light malts and honey. Then there wheat breadiness comes in but it's a little toned down compared to most other beers in the style. The hops presence is very mild and there's a decent balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet.		M: Crisp and a little smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.		D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, it seems like they're trying to make a milder version of a style that is already mild with the result being a mediocre beer at best and it's not much milder than a regular Hefeweizen.",2009-10-06 02:18:13
4.8,935,360,Warsteiner Premium Verum,German Pilsener,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,electricfields,4.0," A: Gold, clear, with a fizzy head that leaves pretty nice looking lacing on the glass.		S: The nice pilsner skunk is already apparent. A sort of bready sweetness with a touch of grassy and citrus hops giving it a sort of sour smell.		T: Fruity and lemon. Very refreshing. That nice skunk flavor is there, but not overwhelming.		M: Thin body. Lots of carbonation.		D: Definitely would be one of my favorite session beers if it was a bit cheaper. Smooth, refreshing, and with a good flavor. The best thing about this beer is how drinkable it is.",2009-10-06 02:19:48
7.0,41010,15237,Struiselensis,American Wild Ale,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,dyan,4.5," **This is a recovered review, original review was 01 August 2008	11.2oz bottle into my Duvel tulip		A: Hazy orange with a thin white head that is initially 1/2"" thick but quickly settles into a thin film. Plenty of carbonation. Swirling this around leaves patchy foam on the side of my glass.		S: An enticing combination of sweet and tart/funk. The sweet component is fruity with pears, mango and citrus while the funk is just that - good ol' Brett funk. Very appealing.		T: Starts out surprisingly sour, causing the taste buds to flinch mildly, making to pucker before pleasant, mild sweetness comes in settles things out, leaving a light, dry yet mildly sweet, long finish that takes on a lemon zest characteristic. I must say this is well balanced!		M: Very good balance between the sweet and sour, wonderfully good carbonation, great finish. Can't ask for much more		D: Easily drinkable but it's my only one :-(		Notes: Your standard Belgian pale, this is not. Good stuff. I'm still learning the nuances of various sours and this one definitely does strike me as different from any other i've had, especially the balance between the fruity flavors and the sour flavors		*Edit 5th October 2009: This has improved hugely, the tropical fruit character with pineapple and mango is absolutely gorgeous, and the way the pedio, the acidity, the fruit and the funk play off each other on the palate is rather fabulous. I have to up the taste score by 0.5",2009-10-06 02:20:07
8.0,38159,14078,Humulus Ludicrous,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,eat,4.0," Pours a viscous golden-honey colour with a frothy off-white head receding to a thin covering...which then disappears. Some lacing in spite of the non-existent head. 		Huge hops smell with fresh cut grass, pine trees and grapefruit all making appearances. A little caramel maltiness in the background. In terms of hoppy beers I've smelt, this is among the very best.		I was actually expecting more hops; the label describes it as ridiculously hoppy and I don't think it's quite there. (EDIT: Okay, this is THEIR most ridiculously hoppy beer. This is a fact.) Still though, it's pretty delicious. The exceptional hops smell doesn't show through as much in the taste. Very well balanced between hops and malt. Canadians don't seem to like brewing such extremely hoppy beers as Americans do. I've only tried one or two Canadian IPA's that compare to American hop bomb-style IPAs and this isn't one of them. The hops are just up to the level where they would be out of balance if there were any more added. The 8% is there only to add an extra tanginess to the hops and is otherwise not perceptible. 		For me, the feel is where this beer shines above all else. For an IPA, this beer has a world-class feel going on; so thick and sticky. This is the feel I always want to find in an IPA and so rarely do. Perfect. 		This is unbelievably drinkable. This could be my favorite Canadian IPA, I can't remember trying one better than this. Thank you Half Pints, this is awesome!",2009-10-06 02:20:09
5.6,2041,703,Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,Dunkelweizen,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,TheManiacalOne,3.5," Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.		A: The beer is a medium brown color, with a large beige head that fades quickly and leaves a spotty lace on the glass.		S: The aroma is faint but contains wheat, caramel, dark malts and a faint touch of hops.		T: The taste starts out bready with flavors of wheat and roasted malts. Then there are some semi sweet flavors of caramel and bananas that comes in. The hops presence is mild but complementary. The after-taste is slightly bready and slightly sweet.		M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.		D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this one is a little darker than most others I've had in the style, but it's a decent beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for this kind of beer.",2009-10-06 02:20:52
9.0,2512,215,Chimay Grande RÃ©serve (Blue),Belgian Strong Dark Ale,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,dyan,4.0," Two years back when my friend bought me a Chimay gift-pack for passing my PhD qualifiers, I stashed the blue away until today. Why? I don't know.		Decanted into my Chimay chalice, this beer is quite the looker. Deep crimson, sanguine almost, with a dense off-white head that recedes to a disk quickly. Great clarity, and plenty of carbonation is present.		The nose is great, with a lot of dark fruit complexity - figs, plums and dates- as well as brown sugar and a little molasses. Bready with the smell of fresh-baked raisin bread as well as some yeast. A touch of oxidation has crept in, lending a little cardboard to the nose. Spicy alcohol is noticeable as it warms up. All told, very very good		Opens big and fruity with plums, raisins and figs as well as a deep and rich bready character, with a mild caramel sweetness. There's a combination of caramel and nougat in here, as well as a rum-like sweetness. Quite deep in flavor. Medium in body with a fabulous, lush carbonation, this is a treat on the palate. A touch sweeter on the finish than I'd like, this beer doesn't really have a long lasting finish like I prefer. Alcohol appears, adding a spicy note. Thoroughly drinkable and enjoyable, this bottle is going down, no problems",2009-10-06 02:21:20
10.0,35923,12985,Devil Dog,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,Docer,3.0," Snagged a bottle...		- Dark caramel color... poured heavily... light head... quickly to a white creamy thin layer....		- Really sweet creamy caramel malt... some floral hops, and fruit. Much too big of a malt profile.... little bit of pine and bitterness.		- Strong creamy caramel malt... way too much sugar, brown sugar, malt... just sweet and thick. Certainly a lot of hops.. pine, bitterness.... floral...		- Chewy... and just too sweet.... sorry!		- Too sweet, and too thick.... not among even my middle 'drinkable' IPA's at all...		(10-06-2009) 4,3.5,2.5,3,2		New review:		Reviewing again... forgot that I had already tried this, and previously gave it a C grade. So I will edit, and see if it has changed over the last year or more.		- Pours a clear copper.. just like a new penny... minimal white head down to a light dusting and a healthy ring of foam.		- Smell is a rather powerful and sweet caramel malt with a touch of brown sugar and some bright citrus hops with a floral nectar as well. Not bad, but the smell isn't overly hoppy as the 7lbs. of hops would lead one to believe.		- A pretty crisp and sweet brew... huge caramel and brown sugar notes in the malt, and a rather nice bitterness that comes through ok. Pine, floral... and a citrus zing... but overall I still think the malt is overpowering... though it compliments the bitterness of the hops. I guess what I am saying, is that it lacks the other hop flavors one would expect from a IIPA.		- Medium to heavy bodied... sweet and syrupy.. a bit chewy and dry.		- Overall it is decent... but it's not a west coast IIPA which are my favorites. They can achieve the strength without being this sweet.",2009-10-06 02:21:38
5.5,40568,718,Petrus Speciale Ale,Belgian Pale Ale,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,BEERchitect,3.5," A deep orange colored beer shows a lot of haze, even yeast 'floaties' mucking about. Initially formitable head falls sooner than I had liked. Slight on lacing and legging.		Fruits and confections lead the way with peaches, pears, apricots, mangos, and papayas. Malt sweetness takes a candy-coated pilsner scent. A growing cheesy note makes the think this bottle isn't the freshest as the beer warms.		Flavors go a good job transitioning from the sugar dipped fruits, sweet pilsner malts, and earthy, herbal notes. Still, that persistent cheese note proves too distracting.		Slight on lasting carbonation, the beer falls a bit heavy and sweet on the tongue after just a few minutes. Lacks creaminess and fullness.		A decent little beer but I do think most of the issues here are due to old bottle.s",2009-10-06 02:21:41
10.5,1056,147,Double Bastard Ale,American Strong Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,Tom8Analise,4.5," A- When poured into a tall glass this beer has a nice golden coloring. Didn't really have any foam but it did leave some lacing on the sides of the glass.		S- Had a nice honey smell, but had an even stronger alcohol smell that overpowerd the honey sweetness.		T- The taste of this beer was the highest rating. There were very nice sweet honey and vanillan notes! The only down side was the after tase, which left a strong alcohol taste in your mouth.		M- very light and smoth but yet had a lot of carbonation.		D- I would love to be able to drink a few of these, but the carbonation was a little to heavy to enjoy more than one.

8.0,49691,4,Allagash Burnham Road,Smoked Beer,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,GeoffFromSJ,4.0," Had this at Tria in Philadelphia. 		Started off pretty darn interesting when it was colder. Smoke, hops, reminded me of salty but that may be my mind playing mental association games with the smoke.		As it warmed, the hops came to dominate which was disappointing. It tasted really good, but I wanted a smoked beer to be somewhat smoky. However, based on the initial sips the hops and the smoke could have been smoothly merged here, but I don't think so.",2009-10-06 02:21:56
5.0,5653,2210,Double Barrel Ale,English Pale Ale,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,callmescraps,3.5," Always an easy drinker.		Appearance - Light amber in color. Two inches of soapy white head that laces somewhat.		Smell - Nice maltiness. Sweet and earthy with only a little of that burnt caramel smell. 		Taste - Malty up front. Almost too sweet, especially on that caramel, but then followed by a nice bitterness to balance things out. Sweetness lingers on the finish. 		Mouthfeel - Nice and smooth. A little creamy.		Drinkability - Pretty solid. This is a nice beverage, but the sweetness makes it something I'll have two of, but maybe not three.		I'm always happy to have this one around. Reminds me of a Sam Adams Boston Lager, in that it's always solid, and would keep it around generally.",2009-10-06 02:23:51
7.2,52334,651,Cold Front,Belgian Dark Ale,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,asabreed,3.5," 12 oz. bottle into a Brooklyn tulip. How is this a Saison? Or is it a brown Saison ala SN?		Appearance: A darker and mildly hazy amber with cola-colored lacing that seems to die a bit faster than it should, especially for a Belgian. 		Smell: A lot of spice and fruit esters and citrus coming in, with some dark cherries, pungent apple skin, and a lot of earthiness with some mild funk. Balanced but could be more complex. Still fairly nice. 		Taste: Spicy, yeasty, distinctly Belgian, with a good amount of citrus hop bitterness and some good dark fruit esters and prominent apple skin. A mild, mild bit of earthy funk too. But the finish is just gone before you know it, which takes it down a notch for me. 		Mouthfeel: Gets to be a bit chalky with the swirl and pour near the end, but before that it's medium bodied with good all-around coating carbonation and doesn't seem cloying. 		Drinkability: A solid brew from Ithaca -- I just want to know what the hell it is. As a Belgian, it's a great sipper over the course of an evening. As a Saison, well, I'm not sure. Worth a try, and I'd try it again.",2009-10-06 02:25:17

Leathery, buttery, earthy tobacco leaf and dark cherries soaked in scotch. Aroma was nicely done but didn't have the WOW factor. Mouthfeel was outstanding. Heavy, syrupy nectar-like feel with a nice chewiness as well. Perfect carbonation. Very drinkable.",2009-10-06 02:26:28
6.5,26203,718,Petrus Dubbel,Dubbel,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,BEERchitect,3.5," A deep brown color is accompanied by a rusty, murky hue. Again for Petrus, this beer has a timid carbonation that produces a head that has a hard time covering the crown of the glass. Slight lacing and legging.		A ton of sugar is used here to make a very sweet Dubbel. Malt breadiness is burried in there but has a hard time competing with the sugary beer base. Peppery and spicy to combat the sweetness but to little avail. Fruity with raisons, dates, figs, plumbs, prunes and other dark and dehydrated fruits.		The sweetness keeps the beer from finishing as dry as I prefer. The weight of the sugars are felt in dramatic fashion. I hope you like your Dubbels sweet.",2009-10-06 02:28:26
9.1,20194,2089,Sleighor Double IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.0,jbhuxley,3.5," This has to be one of the last DIPAs which is regularly available in my area which I have not tried. 		Poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter. 		Pours hazy and copper in color. Forms 1/4"" of off white head which fades to a ring before the first sip. 		The smell is largely dominated by an overwhelming presence of brown sugar with a hint of molasses. There is definitely a resinous pine presence, but I wouldn't call it strong. 		Upon the first taste, the malty presence is most noticable. It is very interesting. It begins with toffee and butterscotch, but as the bitterness kicks in, I'm left with a burn caramel aftertaste. Not necessarily good, but not so bad either. The beer has it's bitterness, but I can't really taste the hops. The ABV is well hidden. 		Mouthfeel is interesting. It is not nearly as sticky or chewy as I would have expected from the smell and even the taste. The carbonation is much greater than I expected, but not at all unpleasent. 		I have came close to purchasing this beer many times. But whenever I ask someone about it, they either have a negative indifferent opinion. In my opinion, it was decent and I am glad I finally got around to trying it. However, there are many better DIPAs out there in this price range.",2009-10-06 02:30:31
7.0,6260,10099,Punkin Ale,Pumpkin Ale,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,Matthoc116,4.0," Poured a nice, clear orange/light amber hue, with low to moderate head. Smells immediately of spice and sweetness, with little hop aroma (as to be expected). Very reminiscent of autumn flavors.		First tasting indicates a very complex brew. Initial reaction is a maltiness, followed by an immediate unexpected (but not unpleasant) tartness. Aftertaste leaves a well-balanced spice flavor, which is then followed by a strong vanilla aftertaste. Would have scored even higher on taste if not for the lingering vanilla extract flavor on the back end.		Overall, one of the better, if not best pumpkin ales I can remember drinking. Often the style gravitates towards one of two extremes: pumpkin-pie beer, or underwhelming squash-ale. DFH manages to find a great balance, and subsequently creates a great beer. Functions well as a dessert beer, or as an autumn warmer. Would and will purchase again.",2009-10-06 02:32:10
7.5,22387,220,Lagunitas Imperial Red Ale,American Strong Ale,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,natelocc787,4.0," Fantastic beer. Hoppy and malty and very well balanced. I love that the hops remind me of an imperial IPA, but the big malt character adds a caramel, big red soda flavor to it. I love big hoppy brews and beers that are nicely balanced. This is a hop bomb and a malt bomb and a very tasty one. Medium-heavy in the mouth with a silky syrupy feel. Very drinkable and a six-pack is a must. I could (and do) drink on this all night. A great go-to for any occasion.",2009-10-06 02:35:11

I was expecting more complexity and deeper flavors*, but what I got instead was a really smooth and pleasant wild ale. Quite drinkable given its alcohol percentage.		* Not saying it isn't deep.

7.7,141,42,Hennepin (Farmhouse Saison),Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.0,3.5,5.0,4.0,Mavajo,4.5," Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.		Pours a cloudy golden yellow color. Nice white head that produces some great looking lacing. The head here is remiscient of Duvel - but not quite as prolific and doesn't retain quite as well.		Smell is citrusy with layers of apple/pear. Taste is similar, but there's also a spice at play. Gives a nice warming sensation. The apple/pear was pretty dominant to me. Left a bit of an aftertaste that I wasn't entirely thrilled with - but I believe it's just personal preference, so I won't mark it down because of that.		Light to medium body and very drinkable. I didn't drink it as quickly as I have some other brews, but I think you could sip this stuff all night. Very nice well rounded brew.",2009-10-06 02:36:20

It had a small, foamy, off-white head that left soapy trails of lace.		S - It smelled of molasses and sweet chocolate. There were mild notes of oatmeal and coffee.		T - It tasted very sweet with chocolate and molasses flavors. Some caramel, too. It had a bourbon kick as it warmed up.		M - It was soft and smooth. A medium to full-bodied ale.

Kind of like a good English Porter..		- Bitterness leaves a touch dry, and the mouth waters as it finds the left over flavors.. which are good.		- Very drinkable... and a great porter. Doesn't stand out much like many others, but I think it touches on the style very nicely.. and isn't an overcarbonated bomb of a porter that is too creamy at the same time.",2009-10-06 02:37:25
5.5,2479,718,Petrus Oud Bruin,Flanders Oud Bruin,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,BEERchitect,4.0," A thin looking beer that pours a russet color. Initially thinly laced, off-white head eventually falls completely still. No lacing, no legging.		Quite tart and woodsy with sour funkiness that weaves in and out of cherry, dark berries, plumb, grape, and red wine vineous character. Brown malts are partially desolved by the musty yeast, but also retains a medium breadiness and malt flavor. 		Malty up front, but thinning at mid palate due to the souring note going into the astringent finish.",2009-10-06 02:38:07
10.3,22352,30,Maharaja,American Double / Imperial IPA,5.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,MisterSH,5.0," Poured into a tulip, my bottle says ""bottled in June 2009 batch 10."" It's October now so this bottle is about three months old or so, been sitting in my fridge for a couple weeks now for the right time. I paid $8.99 for this bomber.		Pours a reddish gold with a nice blonde finger thick head. Looks delicious, I haven't sniffed it yet but the aroma is beginning to waft up from the glass into my nose, this thing is pungent.		Aroma is immediately grapefruity, quite floral hops. A spicy, almost peppery note is apparent, with an element of apple or other sweet fruit. Also a bready malt note.		Taste: Bold and bitter up front, with a very strong, rather sweet malty backbone, and an unusually spicy, grassy finish. Some alcohol warmth (although not what you'd expect at 10.69%). Strongly malty and bready, this is exceptionally well balanced, just how I like an IIPA- not only hoppy, but malty as hell, at 102 IBU's this isn't even close to a hop-bomb, it's a huge beer overall and is surprisingly gentle on the palate. Alcohol is somewhat apparent, but aside from the buzz I am starting to feel as I type this, it is shockingly well hidden considering the beer's strength. This is a deviously drinkable beer.		Mouthfeel is perfect. Creamy, smooth, moderate/low on the carbonation.		WOW! Now this is my idea of a balanced, full bodied, satisfying IPA. Sweet, bitter, powerful, and delicious. A memorable brew and a new favorite for me. Without a doubt, a huge beer, formidable at 10.69%, but I'd crack a second one now if I had it without hesitation. Perhaps a little pricey for frequent consumption, it's worth every penny as a now and then treat when it's available.",2009-10-06 02:42:56
9.5,19216,158,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,Russian Imperial Stout,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,Brad007,4.5," 2007 Edition		Pours a motor-oil black color with a two-finger brown head into my fluted glass.		Aroma is full of oak, bitter coffee, chocolate and cream. Very enticing and seems balanced.		Taste is full of oak upfront that actually feels a bit diluted. It gives way to cream, cocoa and bitter coffee flavors. Alcohol seems dialed down but this is after all, a 2 year old vintage. Everything but the oak seems to show through and that's desirable since you don't want the oak to be overpowering.		Mouthfeel is a bit chewy/smoky from the oak with only faint hints of cocoa, cream and coffee. This is where the oak influence should shine because it affects the texture of the beer, making it more desirable.		Very, very nice! I'm glad I held onto this bottle for a while. It would have been too strong when fresh. Quite possibly the best oak aged beer I've had so far. My only gripe would be that the oak dominates the mouthfeel a bit too much. Regardless, a very enjoyable beer at this stage.",2009-10-06 02:44:02

A- Pours a nearly opaque brown/black color with a thick creamy beige colored head. Some sticky lacing left behind.		S- Nice roasted malt and wet coffee bean aroma. A light chocolate and caramel malt aroma comes through with another whiff.		T- Huge rush of roasted cocoa bitterness initially that gives way to a sweet milk chocolate finish. A nice smoky/coffee flavor is present throughout that adds a bit to a toasted grain maltiness.		M- Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Smooth and creamy but snappy at the same time.		D- Overall a great porter with a big roasted flavor and high drinkability.,2009-10-06 02:44:25
5.9,219,71,Fuller's ESB,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,mdwalsh,4.0," A: A fluffy, full and well textured head on top of an amber-red body. I've been canning so condensation is forming like madness on the glass, but it seems pretty clean and there's nice active carbonation. The color is a little dark, but the great lacing makes up for that. But the head doesn't stay around for long. Sad.	 	S: Light hops, they're very much there, but not overpowering. Herbal, but I pick up a little grapefruit as well. Simple, but you know it's there.		T: Well balanced and light. Not really ""extra bitter"" at all though. I get bready and toasty notes of malt, nothing roasted though, nor burnt. More of a dry malty taste though than sweet, underattenuated malt. Very nice, very quaffable.		M: It leaves me feeling a little dry in the mouth, and I think if I drank this all night I would get serious cotton mouth. But other than that, it's fairly light, not too carbonated but not flat either.		D: As I said, very quaffable. I could see putting back quite a few of these.",2009-10-06 02:44:35
5.0,572,113,"Samuel Smith's, The Famous Taddy Porter",English Porter,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,Mavajo,3.5," Poured into a Duvel tulip glass - didn't have a pint glass on hand.		This was my first porter, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Poured a dark brown color with a light brown head. Head fades quickly.		The nose wasn't revealing much. Maybe it was me. I caught slight hints of chocolate/coffee. Wasn't overly impressed. The taste reflected the smell, but it was a bit easier to pick up on - again, chocolate taste here. No real bitterness to speak of.		Mouthfeel is surprisingly light - I don't think you could categorize it as much more than medium bodied. Fair amount of carbonation, but it wasn't offensive or distracting. To be honest, it almost felt a bit watery to me.		All in all, I've reviewed this beer as I experienced it. From reading the other reviews, mine seems to differ a bit and I wonder if there wasn't some other variable at play. Maybe I'll give it another shot in the future, but for now, this is as I experienced it. All in all a fairly solid beer, but not really thrilled in the least.",2009-10-06 02:44:42
11.0,14882,689,Bare Tree Weiss Wine Vintage 2003,Wheatwine,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,emerge077,4.0," Review from notes, let's try this again after the server crash. 		Super gusher!! Despite sitting in my fridge for a few weeks, it gushed and gushed and gushed some moar. Into multiple cups, all foam for the most part. Ergh. After it subsided there was plenty of long-lasting spotty lacing around the edges. Musty, cidery sweetness in the nose. Huge bubbles in the foam, huge head, doing its best possible Duvel impression. Sweet fruity applesauce flavor dominates, sweet Belgiany yeast notes (apparently hefe & scottish ale yeast was used). Lacking complexity, but still enjoyable. Slight suggestion at tartness, fairly full bodied. Probably on the decline unless this was an isolated infection. Still it wasn't bad, and interesting to try.",2009-10-06 02:47:15
4.9,2212,737,Jever Pilsener,German Pilsener,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,drperm,3.5," 12 oz bottle poured into a tall pilsener glass.		App: Pale gold straw or dandelion tea. Very thin white lace crown.		S: Classic clean pils nose: lots of grain, nuts, noble hops, artisan bread.		T: Subtlety here. It starts off much like a ho-hum international pils, but as it lingers it flirts with the tongue in some fun ways. There's *almost* (not quite) an ale-yeast complexity at work, before it finishes just like a true pilsener with a crispy-clean snap.		M: On the palate it's nearly too thin, but still worthy.		D: Overall, fair. I was hoping for amazing greatness, but such things are elusive here. Still, a nice pilsener that is something beyond the everyday. I see this great with roasted peanuts, light summer fare, or cheese pizza. I'm not going to run out and get more of this right now, but if I were looking for an easy pilsener I'd have it again without thinking twice.",2009-10-06 02:47:39
10.0,52361,287,The Oracle,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,corby112,5.0," Thanks a lot to Tyson and iceicebaby for hooking me up with bottles of this limited brew.		Pours a slightly cloudy golden orange with some light golden ripe banana hues when held to a light source and a one finger frothy off-white head that slowly settles after a bit into a lasting ring that leaves nice sporadic rings of lacing.		Very floral hop aroma with a nice amount of citrus peel as well as some dank, piny resinous hop oil. The malt backbone also contributes to the sweetness. The citrus peel and grapefruit are very prominent, blending well with the earthy hops.		Chewy resinous mouthfeel that is very dry and hop forward. Lots of sweet citrus notes provide an excellent balance to the dry piny bitter hops. Lots of lemon peel and grapefruit sweetness along with the subtle malt backbone provide a nice balance to the massive dry hop explosion that lingers over everything into a long bone dry finish with some slight alcohol heat. The ABV is very well masked, making this dangerously drinkable. 		This is one of the most dry, hoppy beers I've ever had. I'm glad I got to try this fresh when the hops still dominate. Everyone who considers themselves a hophead should seek this out immediately.",2009-10-06 02:49:09

S- Nice nose full of spice and Belgian yeast scents. Easiest to pick out are aromas of clove, dark fruits, oak, and toffee.		T- Full dark malt flavor with waves of clove, currants, figs, sour apples, caramel, and a sweet Belgian yeast finish. The alcohol creates a very slight warming effect on the way down.		M- Medium/full bodied loaded with carbonation. Spritzy and clean.		D- Really nice full flavor. Highly drinkable.",2009-10-06 02:50:00

M: nice full body, but not getting the carbonation others refer to. may have served it slightly too warm.		D: ABV 10.5%? coulda fooled me.

Taste is extremely reminiscent of Driftwood's excellent Farmhand Ale, but without the Farmhand's sometimes overweening black pepper finish.

12.5,32413,18149,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,American Strong Ale,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,BEERchitect,4.5," Finally, a Lost Abbey beer that lives up to its billing.		The beer pours with a cola-like russet brown/red color with slight haze. Light carbonation allows a lace of foam to settle and blanket the beer. Light on lacing but brandy-like with the legs.		Irresistable aromas of heavy malts, cotton-candy sweetness, sweet rums and brandy alcohols, dried fruits of currants, plumbs, dates, prunes, grapes, raisons, apples, and berries. Hops are low and may take on an herbal tone that gets lost in the woodsy oak and nutty character.		Flavors are more balanced between the sweet malts, fruits, and alcohols; and the bitter and tannin rich woods and hop bitterness. Still has all the right ingredients but the bourbon flavor and oak character interfere with the delicate sweetness more in taste than in aroma.		Rich and rounded up front without thickness or heaviness. Tanin astringency helps to dry out the beer going into the finish; maybe too much. Powdery and bitter late.		It's obvious to see why this is among the world's best beers. If the rest of the beer lived up to that aroma, we'd be talking flawless here.		Thanks JNN4V!",2009-10-06 02:52:35

Smell: Just like a cup of joe. bitterness of coffee...smells like starbucks		taste: taste like it smells. im not a huge coffee fan but this has all the characteristics that I like from coffee without any harsh bitterness. Exactly like a cup of coffee with a touch of milk and sugar. love it. The milk or lactose gives it a real nice smooth taste which complements the bitterness of the espresso		Drinkability: love the beer.very big flavors. if you gave this to me in the morning in place of coffee i almost couldn't tell the difference. the only small negative is that it dries my mouth out slightly but its no biggy. glad I have more of them,2009-10-06 02:52:47
5.4,18676,9866,Denison's Weissbier,Hefeweizen,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,MeisterBurger,4.0," I've had this on tap on countless occasions over the years, and only once was it not quite up to snuff (the place that was serving its fault). It's a great beer, probably one of the best locally brewed beers going. If I reviewed the beers I drink when I am out with friends (I don't) I likely would have given it pretty close to top marks in all categories when served on tap.		As it is I have here in front of me the long awaited take-home version from a very smart looking blue and gold can.		It pours a lovely turbid honey color with a decent amount of head, but not as much as the majority of its bottled Bavarian brethren, which is a bit of a letdown, as half the fun of a good hefe is that rocky chunky giant head that sticks around. The draught version does this much better as I recall. The can...it dies down and doesn't retain overly well, at least not for a hefe. 		The aroma is creamy bananas and cloves, bubblegum, dry saltines, and toffee.		And then there's the taste...which doesn't quite match the draught version exactly. On tap it hits all the marks of the style elegantly with nice big banana notes. In the can there's a little too much sour lemon throwing things off, a slightly tart and plasticy phenol or something. Not horrible. Just not something I noticed in the draught version. The usual banana and cloves are there, as is some clean wheat, and a hint of toasty biscuit malt and a peppery finish. It's more lemony and less banana-centric taste of the draught version. 		The canned version is refreshing and light on the palate, less creamy than it is on tap.		For the purposes of this review I kind of landed somewhere between the can and on tap in my grading.",2009-10-06 02:53:25
5.2,47293,19127,Flywheel Bright Lager,German Pilsener,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,trbergman,3.5," 12oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass.		A - More amber-gold than straw in color, with a towering, bone-white head that sticks around and leaves plenty of lace. A slight chill haze, perhaps, with vigorous bubbling carbonation.		S - Bready, biscuit-like malt, herbal and floral hop aroma, some grass.		T - Again, bready, maybe a touch of sweetness, with noble hop flavor and a refreshing, spicy bite. Bitterness lingers on the palate.		M - I think this is where the beer falls short. For the style, it seems a bit flabby.		D - This is a solid pils, but I think it could be even better with a tweak of the hop/malt ratio, to give it a more spritely character with a lighter body. As it is, I'd still call it a good candidate for a session.",2009-10-06 02:53:48

Some hay and earthiness in there.		- Wonderful complex flavor of grain, slight funk, tart and yet smooth... and the grapes... love the currants in the background. Fantastic from start to finish.... and boy how it changes all in just only 1 gulp.		- Slightly dry, but so zesty, the mouth waters....		- Super drinkable, and not a mind blowing sour bomb.

10.0,7334,634,Kapittel Abt,Tripel,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,drpimento,4.5," Excellent beer. Poured with a huge foamy, frothy, textured off-white head and lots of lace. Color is a nice medium amber. Had an odd clearness with the yeastoids poured at the end in suspension; so, hazy on top, clear on the bottom. Aroma was caramel and toffee. Flavor was the same, but much more intense. Body is really interesting, full and sweet but sharp with carbonation that is spot on and ultimately just right. Finish is bittersweet and intriguing. An odd cross between a digestive and just a tasty, satisfying brew. Kudos; I bow down before you.",2009-10-06 02:55:57
9.0,412,112,Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout,Russian Imperial Stout,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,natelocc787,4.5," Old Rasputin...In my circle the name says it all. Nice thick, black/brown body with about every shade of brown visible in the head. A large head emerges after the pour smelling of roasted malt, espresso, milk chocolate and dark chocolate and vanilla bean. As the head fizzles slowly, thick chunks of milk chocolate mousse lace appear at the sides of the glass and craters are formed at the zenith. The taste is magnificent: graham cracker, molasses, espresso, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, hot fudge syrup and light toffee. All flavors complement the roasty black malt backbone. Very thick and chewy as a top notch RIS should be. Luxurious mouthfeel. Very invigorating as it fulfills all expectations. Simply put, still the RIS all others are judged by.",2009-10-06 02:56:10
8.0,1792,73,Great Lakes Nosferatu,American Strong Ale,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,Vonerichs,4.0," Amber color, a little deeper in the red category. Off white head, moderate lacing. 		Heavy caramel malt nose with a slight hint of pine hops. For a strong ale, the scent is weak.		The taste is more pronounced than the smell and the malt is almost too syrupy. I also pick up a buttery flavor that's common among a couple of the Great Lakes brews that I've tried. The hops add a slight bitterness, but I wish there was more and the malt throws this a little out of whack. 		Decent carbonation, heavy body, but a bit boozy for 8% abv.		This was ok, but I was a bit dissapointed because I had higher expectations. There are much better stong ales out there.",2009-10-06 02:57:59
9.5,40681,922,Achel Trappist Extra,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,tempest,4.5," Split a bottle at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA. Why, why, why does this beer have to be nearly $29? It's easily the best the legal (not Westvleteren) Trappist beer I've had. Damn. The flavor is soft and malt-heavy with an earthy background. The barley brings a complex mix of typical but delicious candy flavors: figs, toffee, caramel, and cocoa. They're subtle flavors that develop as you sip though, not like some big beer that knocks your palace out. This is an experience, not just a drink. Find this beer.",2009-10-06 02:58:16

S- Huge wave of roasted dark malt mixed with coffee and cocoa. I can already tell that this one is going to be good...		T- Roasted/charred espresso beans with a bittersweet chocolate finish. The cocoa flavor seems to serve as the bittering ingredient while coffee and sweet malt flavors develop throughout. Definitely a bit of molasses and roasted nut flavor as well. 		M- Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Slightly thinner than I thought it would be but still smooth and creamy.		D- This one is worthy of it's praise. The alcohol is barely noticeable at all even though it is at a whopping 12%! I'll be picking this one up again soon.,2009-10-06 03:00:15

Ok, this is supposedly the ""funky sour"" batch that turned...I have to say it turned out better than the '03 we had in the same night. 		Rusty orange in the glass, strong retention with arcs of lacing inside the glass. A nice acetic Flemish sour aroma... funky, cheesy, cidery. Overripe brown apples rotting in the grass under orchard trees in the midday sun. With a swirl, there's a slightly sharp vinegar element. Flavor is yeasty, with a dominating grape champagne yeast character. Tart, dry, and savory...everything I want in a sour ale, not so much in a wheatwine, but i'm enjoying it for what it is. It seems almost like a Berliner Weisse/Barleywine hybrid, as weird as that sounds. If this was billed as a Wild Ale, it would be #1 on the hype train. As it stands, it's a forgotten experiment that had potential... Throw this on oak 2 Bros ;)",2009-10-06 03:00:16
6.2,51573,96,Odd Notion (Fall 2009),Belgian Dark Ale,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,BEERchitect,3.0," The beer pours Stout-like enough with a dark brown, opaque appearance. A loosely knit head gives lightly tanned foam that laces fairly and with little legging.		Very smokey for a beer that should be centered around roasted malts and spicy Belgian yeast. Malts bring a lot of roasted and char aromas and flavor with a coffee, burnt cocoa, and hazelnut hint here and there. Belgian character is slight but with light tartness of blueberries, black raspberries, and currants, and grapes. 		Quite sweet and abrasive textures work to dry out in the end but can't hardly seal the deal. A lot of cola-like residual sweetness is left on the mouth's surfaces. The beer is kinda everywhere except for the focus on chocolate and Belgian traits. Smokey as hell though.",2009-10-06 03:01:10

8.74,52077,220,A Little Sumpin' Extra! Ale,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,number1bum,4.0," Thanks to mymrnngjckt for a bottle of this. You are a fine man, sir. 		Pours a slightly cloudy light amber color with a tangerine tint to it. Keeps a thin but pretty full lace, and a ring of stick on the sides.		Smells of oily, sappy, resiny hops, with lots of grapefruit pith, juicy orange, pine. Tons of hop character. There's also a quick whiff of booze.		Taste also has a big resiny, juicy hop flavor to it. There is a juicy sweet citrus flavor of clementines and tangerines, with a bit of sugary sweetness to it as well. Tons of citrus hoppiness, but also some pine and leafy, herbal flavor. Not a whole lot of malt character per se, but the sugary sweetness does give a bit of balance. It's not a terribly bitter beer, as the hops provide a ton of flavor rather than just bitterness. There's a bit of hot alcohol in the finish, as there was in the nose, which makes it just a tad rough and gives it a bit of a bite.		Mouthfeel is not quite a true full body, but rather a medium-full one. The beer is on the sweet side so the one knock I have on the mouthfeel, unsurprisingly, is that it's a little too sticky sweet; not really cloying, but sticky. It's pretty creamy however, and quite smooth, with a bit of alcohol heat in the back of the throat through the finish. 		This is a very tasty beer and would be an especially good choice for someone who isn't wild about hop bitterness but loves hop flavor. It's not as bitter as Hop Stoopid, and has more citrus flavor as opposed to the huge resiny, herbal flavors. It's very juicy, and just full of flavor. This is a big hoppy beer that you could actually session. Very good, and if not for the alcohol bite it would be outstanding.",2009-10-06 03:02:33

S: The nose is full of both sour cherries and sweet cherries, with each playing off the other very well.

Head fades quickly to a cap and leaves a little bit of lace on the glass.		S- Malty and sweet with notes of caramel and toffee, some grain or adjuncts in there as well.		T- Sweet with an undertone of grapes to it from beginning to end. As this warms, a little of the caramel starts to show up in the flavor profile. Finish is quick and clean with a little fizz of carbonation and almost no aftertaste.		M- Light in body and high in carbonation, a real contradiction from the appearance.		D- 4.6% ABV, nice, light, and refreshing this is a definite session beer.		Crazy beer - tastes like grapes, black in color but light in feel and taste, no appearance of high carbonation but fizzy on the tongue.		Note: There are two breweries that brew this beer.

I am not gonna lie....this tastes exactly like the barley wine i brewed a while back. Heavy on the crystal malt, and just enough hops to have a little bitterness on the back end of the sip.		Pours a dark brown with a light brown head that dissipates quickly, leaving little to no lacing.		Good flavor, though for the style the mouthfeel was a bit thin...for a RIS, I want it chewy.		Not enough alcohol in this either...7% is a bit low, it doesn't even come through as it warms. Lends to the drinkability though, and with any more alcohol, the mouthfeel would thin out even more.

5.0,17982,292,Kirin Tanrei,Happoshu,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,csmiley,3.0," Many thanks to prototypic for giving me the chance to try this style out.		A - This beer pours pale yellow and crystal clear. The white head is fairly minimal and barely covers the top of the beer. It sticks around for a few seconds and - poof! Gone. No lacing at all. 		S - Aroma is mild but that is pretty much expected. Some bread starts it out. Mostly resembles white bread with some cracker that is barely noticeable in the background. The end has some graininess to it. No alcohol is noted in the aroma.		T - Bread pops up in the flavor as well. Sticks with the white bread theme that was in the aroma. Grain is more persistent in the flavor and has a sharp almost wheat twang to it. Could be some hard candy in the background. Alcohol is only barely present at the finish.		M - Light bodied with little carbonation that shows in the glass. Once on the palate though, this beer becomes practically effervescent. Finish is a tad dry and doesn't stick around for very long.		D - Drinkability is not too bad for the Tanrei. It's light and provides at least some legitimate refreshment. Kind of like an American Adjunct Lager with a little more flavor. Seems like this beer was intended for mass consumption. Moderate alcohol and mild flavors add to that idea. Along with the style description that gives it a ""cheap beer alternative"" moniker. Overall, really stoked that I got to try the style out. Probably wouldn't be something I'd seek out again.",2009-10-06 03:11:58

9.0,34,22,La Fin Du Monde,Tripel,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,mirish72,4.5," Poured into my Chimay goblet. Poured an orange amber with visible yeast.		Has a great aroma. Nice blend of spicy hops, fruity sweetness and a slight bready smell. Good strong characteristics of a tripel. Beer is fairly high in carbonation but overall it is very drinkable and hides the 9% very well. 		Probably one of the better non-Belgian tripels I have had in a while, I am slowly making my way through a number of Unibroue offerings and I have yet to be disappointed.",2009-10-06 03:14:40

5.0,580,105,Miller High Life,American Adjunct Lager,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,daledeee,3.0," I do my best to like the big American brands. Why spend a bunch for beer if you can buy the lower priced stuff that is easy to get?		I told my wife. Somebody sent this home with me from a party and I will dump it out if I don't like it. 		I poured it and it had a decent 1"" head and was as clear straw yellow as the next one. The nose is nonexistent but the nice feature is that it does not have an aftersmell or an off scent that makes it difficult to enjoy some of the other macros. They may taste ok but don't smell good at all. Not mentioning any names. 		The taste is clean sweet and grainy. Quite easy to drink and quite easy to enjoy. I told myself, this will go downhill as the beer sits and beer warms. It tasted the same at the end as at the beginning. I must say, this is one of the best, if not the best, macro made in America. The quest goes on, but I think I have had most of them..",2009-10-06 03:21:11

A well balanced beer more malt accented. Caramel and munich malts are there, as well as a subtle piney hop.		Medium bodied with a spritzy carbonation.		Drinkability is strong.

8.5,142,42,Ommegang (Abbey Ale),Dubbel,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,MaineBirdMan,3.5, Had this Abbey Ale out of a 12oz bottle. I was quite pleased with this Ale.	Appearance: Poured the beer into a pint glass. I know I should have used a different glass but I had to use what I had. There was a nice head (about a quarter of an inch). There was a red almost cranberry color.		smell/nose: There was a mild scent of hops mixed with candied fruit.		taste: sweet candy flavor. A little bitter but not overpowering. Nice amount of hops. There was almost a cherry cough syrup flavor towards the end of the beer. It did have a very smooth finish. It did linger on the tongue. With a ALC/VOL at 8.5% I could sense some of the alcohol but it wasn't overwhelming. 		Drinkability: Easy to drink a few but the sweetness makes it hard to have too many.,2009-10-06 03:21:38

Copperish pour. Decent lacing.		S: Very light malts. Breadiness and faint hops. Not much here...		T: Carmel malts and some toffee flavors. Light earthy hops and a small amount of bitterness. Overall the flavor is very bland and subdued. I even let it warm up to room temp and no change.		M: Light bodied. Creamy and smooth off the cask.		D: At 5.3 ABV, this beer is easily sessionable. I personally wouldn't however, as I had trouble finishing a single pint.		Average at best and very forgettable. For me, BRBP beers are very hit and miss, and Traveling John's Best Bitter was a brew I won't be revisiting.",2009-10-06 03:25:11

Pours a thick, almost pitch black with some dark brown around the edges. There's a slight brown ring but no real head to speak of. Minimal retention. 		The smell is complex--wood, espresso, molasses, toasted malts, oatmeal & slightly viney. 		The taste is bitter from the burnt malts, strong roasted coffee, and surprising bitter citrus hops. There's also a richness with flavors of oatmeal and molasses. Mouthfeel is crisp and carbonated but thick like motor oil. 		This is a complex RIS with the interesting hoppiness and crispness. It is a bit more burnt/bitter than I expected, but that helped completely cover the ABV.",2009-10-06 03:25:28

A bit of scattered lacing on the sides. No light is visible through the glass.		S- Freshly ground coffee beans with some dark chocolate bitterness. A faint whiff of alcohol.		T- Overwhelmingly roasted coffee flavor with bitter cocoa nib finish. Espresso and smoke add to the coffee onslaught. The alcohol is quite apparent and stings a bit upon a large gulp. The slightest amount of sweet malt is noticeable as a small relief to the bitterness of the coffee and cocoa.		M- Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Alcohol isn't very hidden.		D- A really interesting brew that is a must try for coffee fans.,2009-10-06 03:26:45
5.6,408,112,Old #38 Stout,Irish Dry Stout,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,mdwalsh,4.5," A: Pours kind of brown/red from the bottle, but almost pitch black in the glass. Red notes around the side. Full head of small bubbles and quite the smooth texture on top. Did the whole Guinness falling bubbles thing even. The head is a little too bubbly though. Too many large gas pockets.		S: Hello roasted malt, how are you today? I get black patent/roasted unmalted barley pretty strong. Coffee like without being coffeeish. I also get notes of burnt sugar and caramel. Some cloying sweetness. Dark cooked fruits, like cooking cider or jelly or applesauce.		T: Dry, that's for sure, not as much sweetness as I got in the nose, but I think the real dryness here comes from a dry taste, as in the taste of dry roasted [blank]. Be that coffee or malt or whatever. That's what I taste. No hops really, just roastedness.		M: Dry, very dry. That's about it.

The smell was nice but not great. Malt and apricot were present but made an appearance instead of a performance.		T: Nice mild malt flavor and discernable apricot. It gave me the classic instant reward of good beer flavor. The only reason that I didnt rate the beer higher was that there is a flavor that is a bit metallic but only faintly so.		M: Clean, crisp, and delightfully bubbly. Couldnt ask for anything more.		D: This stuff is refreshing and sessionable. The only aspect that would make this any more drinkable is the flavor.		I usually dont grab this stuff when I make my way to Alpine but there was a chance my wife might enjoy it. When we had the AN with our dinner tonight I was pleasantly surprised on two accounts, one that I liked the beer more than I had remembered and and two, that my wife said that it was one of the better beers that she had tasted.

7.0,3951,10099,ApriHop,American IPA,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,originalsin,3.0," Spent all summer downing pints of this delightfully refreshing offering from Dogfish Head. 	Big citrus hops on the nose with the ever-present scent of apricot working its way deep into my nostrils.	With regard to taste, there isn't anything phenomenal going on here- it's a pretty standard IPA that manages to gain a bit of something from light tart notes and the pervasiveness of the apricot. 	It's a bit dry for my liking but drinks brilliantly anyway. I'm sure I'll be drinking this one through the many summers to come.",2009-10-06 03:31:21

I took some mental notes on this one this time (I've had it before and was not overly impressed).		Poured from 12 oz. bottle into chilled pint glass.		Appearance: Clear deep amber color with minimal head that didn't retain long and laces a little.		Smell: Fairly faint scents to this one. A little caramel malt with maybe a little hops underneath.		Taste: Like it smells, malty and some slight hops flavor. It's a low ABV beer, but can taste the alcohol in it, odd.		Mouth Feel: Light to medium body. Crisp carbonation. Average.		Drinkability: A fairly pedestrian American Amber beer (not one of my favorite styles to begin with). It's not bad, but it's not anything special either.",2009-10-06 03:31:32

It dissipates instantly with no lacing or carbonation. Please Tomme, check your bottling line. There's probably a flaw in your physical sanitation that is causing the problem.		S - Chocolate, light roast coffee, bourbon, oak and vanilla. Wow, very good.		T - Heavier notes of dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, oak and vanilla. As it warms up there is lots of caramel and butterscotch flavors, appears to have gone through a 120 minute boil at least.		M - Light to medium in body, malt dominated, and smooth. Where's the alcohol? Amazing for a 12% beer.		D - A very complex beer and good overall. With some carbonation and a heavier body, this beer would receive perfect scores.",2009-10-06 03:34:48

Doesn't smell like any imperial ipa i've ever had, or at least none that I can remember. This one reminds me a lot more of an american barleywine. Floral hops take a bit of a back seat to the huge malt backbone that makes its presence felt.		The taste doesn't diverge too much from the smell. Sweet and caramel malts. Reminds me a lot of the 90 minute. Even in the mouthfeel. First DFH beer I've ever had that I've been able to easily compare to something else of theres... interesting. 		It's a good beer, that's for sure. Drinkability was ok. Only had one nonetheless, and I probably wouldn't try it again.

7.0,6260,10099,Punkin Ale,Pumpkin Ale,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,stewart124,4.0, Pours a tea color with a nice white head.		The smell is of baked pumpkin pie and nutmeg or maybe it is an allspice. Needless to say my mouth is watering.		On the first sip I am almost wondering if I received the correct beer. Very low key pumpkin beer. The spices are subtle but spicy in the finish and almost produce a boldness that I wasn't quite expecting.		There is a nice caramel/toasty note. The spices are great and this makes for a drinkable pumpkin ale. Very tasty indeed.,2009-10-06 03:37:57

A - Pours dark brown with 1 finger of cappucino head, which dissipates immediately. Leaves little lacing.		S - Leather, chocolate, oak, bourbon, vanilla, and light alcohol.		T - Lots of leather coming through with chocolate, oak, bourbon, vanilla, bittering hops, and light alcohol. Gets more caramely as it warms up, but not too viscousy.		M - Medium bodied, malty and light alcohol.		D - Very good. I would recommend you seek out the XII as it is the better beer. This one is very enjoyable too.",2009-10-06 03:39:34

A: Poured a golden amber with a perfect head. Lacing galore.		S: Double IPA this is. An unbelievable combination of hops gives this beer a smell that is just pure fresh hops... makes Sam Adams Boston Lager seem like Natty Lite.		T: This beer is so full of flavor that I can't really describe it. It's predominantly hops, and hardly any bitterness at all. Malt adds character and makes this less dry on the tongue than I expected. Loads of other flavors are present.		M: Just perfect. Not too much carbonation... the full flavor can be noticed without any discomfort.		D: Take it easy. It's 9% alcohol... you really only need one of these a night.		I am making a bee-line for Kroger tomorrow to get a 6-pack of this stuff, because it's ridiculous. One of the best DIPA's I've ever had.",2009-10-06 03:40:40
8.27,25258,144,Pipers Scotch-Style Ale,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,indiapaleale,4.0," Pour - Pipers pours a lot like unfiltered apple cider. The head is a big, off-white and composed of lots of little bubbles. Strings of tiny bubbles rush upwards through a rather murky looking beer.		Aroma - Very sweet. Brown sugar and caramel with some baked apples. There is a great smokiness to this as well, it reminds me of some of the peatier Scotch whiskeys I've had.		Taste - Like a smoked candied apple. Sweet and smokey, a very nice combo. Reminds me of an apple orchard with on a fall day with someone burning wood nearby. Toffee notes combine with the fruity esters to make for one full bodied and flavorful beer. The alcohol is definitely noticeable and provides some heat along with a somewhat dry finish.		Overall - Excellent smokey scotch ale. The combo of sweet and smokey is a great one. I am warm and happy.",2009-10-06 03:41:27

A: Cloudy pale orange-yellow, about a fingers worth of head,,, nice ring of foam thought the session... Very nice lacing.		S: Lemons right out of the gate, little Banana & clove with a wheat tanginess...maybe a little grassy too.		T: Prominently lemon with some pepper... tangy wheat and a little grassy.... there is a hint of banana and clove floating around the finish... pretty damn good.		M: Thin at the front, but the finish is a little on the creamy side. Carbonation is right on for the style. Aftertaste is light and refreshing.

9.0,49838,10099,Squall IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,originalsin,4.5," Infinite thanks to the Fat Dongo himself for bringing a bottle of this out to LA to share. 		Poured side by side into 2 Stone pint glasses. The pour is a bright reddish brown with a nice slim white head that laced well throughout. Some solid chunks of gooey yeast could be seen at the bottom of the bottle- don't see yeast in such quantaties that often, I feel like. All I could think of while drinking this beer was the 90 minute IPA. I really wish I had one to taste side by side so as to notice the nuances. It's been too long (maybe a few weeks) since my fridge has been blessed by the presence of that awesome beer.		Couldn't help but notice how complex this beer was on the nose. There's an awful lot going on here- big citrus hop aroma mingles with some sweet malt and a whole lot of grapefruit. 		There's a bit too much alcohol in the aftertaste of this one. That's my only real qualm with the beer. Otherwise the flavor is remarkably similar (wonder why) to the 90 minute. More hoppy, perhaps. The malt profile is obviously the same, though, and as such the mouthfeel is just about exactly the same. 		To be perfectly honest, I liked this beer more than 90 minute, and that's saying something, but I'm not sure what to attribute that to. It's drinkability doesn't quite compare and otherwise it's pretty similar. Maybe it's just a novelty issue. But anyway, this one probably tastes better and certainly has more to offer when it comes to aroma.",2009-10-06 03:46:16

Pours black (no way!) with a thick light-beige head that leaves great lacing. Typical weizen character in the aroma, but augmented by a sharp, bitter roastiness that seems quite unusual. Light banana notes. Interesting, but not necessarily bad. Notes of carbon/graphite. Dry, roasty taste with the typical tangy yeast. Really interesting stuff. Medium, well-carbonated body. Though I'm a fan of the regular Kapuziner weisse, this one doesn't quite stand up. Interesting for sure, but not a favorite.",2009-10-06 03:49:21

S - Barny, some tartness in the air. Small dole of malt.		T - Wow. Sweet tart city. Tart up front, some sweet malt in center, some funky barn flavors at finish. Bitter grapefruit. Fun beer.

11.1,1566,392,Blithering Idiot,English Barleywine,4.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,dyan,3.0," 12oz bottle from last years' release. I've had this a while, just getting around to drinking it.		Mildly hazy with a gorgeous dense beige head that recedes to a disk and then a ring, leaving a little lace.		The nose is rather simple, with a sweet sugar syrup character with toffee and caramel. It doesn't have the depth and complexity that I've found in the best beers of this style. Mild honey floral character is present as well.		The palate is one dimensional, sweet and syrupy with a touch of burnt sugar and alcohol burn on the finish. For a beer as sweet, the body is paradoxically thin, it doesn't have the expected heft. This really is rather mediocre, lacking in depth and finesse.		Medium in body while managing to feel light, this is a disappointment. The finish is all sugar and alcohol. On the bright side, the carbonation is quite stunning - soft, suffuse, and lush		This really is a chore to drink, and I'm not going to bother.",2009-10-06 03:54:27

A - Clear, bright pale straw with ample carbonation and one finger of dense, sticky head. Plenty of gorgeous lacing all the way down the glass.		S - Subdued aroma of saltines or water crackers, very little hop aroma -- maybe a bit grassy.		T - Spot on. Very nice cereal flavor without being sweet. Assertive hop bitterness with a hint of lemon zest and a little leafy. Finishes quite dry.		M - Light and soft body with a subtle zip of fine-bubbled carbonation.		D - I wouldn't call this beer complex. But if you're going to make a simple beer, you can't make any mistakes, and Krankshaft doesn't have any major flaws. Enjoyable from start to finish, and probably through several more bottles. I can't recommend this beer highly enough.",2009-10-06 03:55:02
5.0,573,113,Samuel Smith's India Ale,English India Pale Ale (IPA),4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,TheManiacalOne,4.0," Poured from an 18.7oz bottle into an imperial pint glass.		A: The beer is a light gold color, with a short off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.		S: The aroma is of caramelized malts, citrus, honey and a good amount of hops.		T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of citrus, caramel and honey. Then there's a strong but not-over-powering hops bitterness that comes in next to provide a good balance. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly hoppy.		M: Smooth and very crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.		D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice session beer with a lot of flavor and substance that makes it worth drinking for a long time.",2009-10-06 03:56:13
5.4,14625,6372,Z Lager,Rauchbier,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,wiseguy142,3.5," I always like amber lagers.. I don't know why. Especially when you're not talking Oktoberfests/Vienna lagers.. these things seem to always pop up as gems in smaller breweries. 		Pours a hazy dark amber... sort of like a pumpkin past its prime. Thin head with average lacing pretty gone within a minute after pouring. Very hazy but with some mysterious bubbles moving up through the middle.		Aroma is very light.. any smoke flavor seems to blend in with the amber very well, but a nice complex amber aroma up front. 		Taste is a little tame, but a nice semi-sweet lager. I feel like I'm describing a wine. Smoke flavor is far in the back backing up the amber flavor. Fruity around the edges. Definitely let down in terms of smoke flavor but I'm enjoying it. Mouthfeel is a hit as is drinkability, because it's a nice easy drinking, flavorful lager which is why I like this style. We used to get kegs of Rohrbach's Amber Lager in college and it was always a treat. Not sure if this is what they were going for here.

5.1,4312,1549,Oatmeal Stout,Oatmeal Stout,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,mdwalsh,4.0," A: Very black, with a tan head. But even though it's super black, and I can't see any light through this thing, something still screams brown about it. But it's totally opaque. The head is thin, and fades fast. The darkness really gives this beer street cred.		S: Oatmeal. With seasoning. I assume it's malt and hops, but it makes me think of breakfast cereal oatmeal with honey or cinnamon or something along those lines. Very bready, but clean. Not terrible strong, but strong enough.		T: Very nice and smooth without being slick. I remember drinking this when I was maybe 16 and hating it. Now I like it much better. It's not too heavy, really, and I can tell how low the ABV is. I still taste the cooked cereal, but any hint of seasoning/hops is gone. It's pretty dry, but not too roasted, which is nice. I get a little sweetness on the aftertaste/swallow, but at the same time more roasted flavor. Very nice balance between those two.		M: Hmm. Not heavy, but thick. Leaves a slightly dry feeling in the mouth, remarkably similar to eating cold oatmeal. Yes, I have, camping with a bad stove. But still smooth and enjoyable.

Very dark with not much like escaping its grasp	S.CHERRY! it really hit my nose stronger then any other part.	T. I first am hit by roasted malt. After that there is a bitter after taste that I am putting it to be a factor of the cherry.	M. Very carbonated. Almost as much as Pepsi or some other soda pop. For a darker beer this is not what I was thinking it would be.	D. I could drink this on a regular basis for sure. Not saying every day but a couple time a month i would be okay by me.,2009-10-06 04:01:52
9.0,52007,10097,Harpoon Leviathan - Saison Royale,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,asabreed,2.0," 12 oz. bottle into a Brooklyn tulip.		Appearance: Lighter golden yellow, a big rush of foam that sinks down back to the body. Not a lot of bubbles. Not looking very Belgian or Saison-like. 		Smell: I made a beer from the MrBeer kid called 3 Spice Lemon Weiss or something like that, and the smell was almost identical to this. It was coriander, cinnamon, and lemon juice, and maybe some nutmeg. This has a lot of ginger in there also. I was fairly happy with the one I made from a kit and extract and whatnot, but here they're CLEARLY doing basically the same thing. Instead of letting the yeast do its thing along with the phenolic activity and mysteries abound that could happen, they over-spice it like the world's going to end. It's like a pumpkin beer gone serial killer, with a ton more spice added. Floral for, say, a candle? Yes. For a beer, one that's supposed to be a Saison? No. And I would bet that if you make the aforementioned recipe, you'll enjoy it more than this. If I had a bottle from a year ago or so, I'd try them together, and I have a feeling the one I made would win. 		Taste: Way too sweet. Hardly any earthiness or phenolic activity at all. More like a Wit than a Saison, but truly neither like either, if you want to go there. Kind of hurts your teeth, too. Way too sweet, again. Not a lot of flavor. All you taste is spice. 		Mouthfeel: Big time cloying sugar bomb. Way too much sugar all around. 		Drinkability: Not a Saison in the least. Way too much alcohol. Not enough balance at all. As an addendum, I'm finishing this review now, and the rest of it's going down the drain... I won't buy this again, but the Leviathan DIPA was good I thought, so I won't give up on the series. Just don't make this anymore please, Harpoon. It's not good. That's it.",2009-10-06 04:06:21
6.0,1917,192,La Folie,Flanders Red Ale,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,bulletrain76,4.5," 22oz bottle purchased earlier this summer down in Orange County. Dark red-brown with a medium beige head. The aroma has a lot of rich tobacco, with tart green apple, pear, and toasted oak as well. The flavor is firmly sour, but has a nice malt balance that provides an earthy chocolate flavor without being too sweet. Lemon and cherry come to mind when thinking of fruit tartness present. Medium thickness on the tongue with ample carbonation. Seems pretty similar to Rodenbach GC, which I should have figured I guess. Great beer with a nice complexity to the sourness.",2009-10-06 04:07:47
5.3,3041,923,True Blonde Ale,American Blonde Ale,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,Brewsta,4.0," Good stuff. I like the smoothness of this beer, not overly hopped. I've been drinking this beer after working hard moving rock around in the yard or just watching MNF. I think the taste could be bolder, however, it's a solid beer with its smoothness and light malted wheat flavor.		Overall a well balenced wheat beer.",2009-10-06 04:11:34

S- Spicy caramel malt with a some bitter hops. Slightly more hops than I've encountered in most traditional Oktoberfest beers.		T- Decent wave of hoppy spice bitterness with some vegetal flavors and a soapy finish. Not exactly what I was expecting. Alcohol is fairly apparent even though this one only clocks in at 6.5%.		M- Light/medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Soapy aftertaste lingers.		D- I was a bit surprised that this wasn't better than I expected. Great Lakes puts out some very good beers but this one missed the mark.,2009-10-06 04:15:41

Color is a lovely, clear coppery amber. Aroma is yeasty and malty. Flavor is dates, figs, raisins, and dark bread. Body is great as is carbonation. Finish ditto.

9.0,46749,113,Samuel Smith's Yorkshire Stingo,English Strong Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,BedetheVenerable,4.5," Presentation: 550ml Victorian Pint bottle; really nice traditional Samuel Smith label, with some nice info on the back of the bottle as well; this is the 2008 vintage. Served at cellar temperature in a 20oz Black Sheep Riggwelter pint glass.		Apperance: Hazy burnt-orange beer with amber tints; high levels of small-bead carbonation keeps an attractive beige 1/2 finger of head on this beer long after the substantial head has fallen. 		Smell: Simultaneously intensely malty and fruity. Sweet caramel notes mingle with hints of alcohol and some tart dark fruit (maybe cherries?) There's also just a hint of that earthy yeastiness so typical of Samuel Smith beers. Maybe just a ghostly buttery character. The ONLY gripe here is I'd like juts a bit more intensity here from the aromas.		Taste: A wonderful balance between malty sweetness and mildly tart fruitiness. A light warming alcohol is present from the beginning as well. There are sweet, dark (almost burnt) caramel flavors up front, backed by tart dried cherries. Hopping is quite subdued, but a light fruity tartness keeps this beer from becoming overly sweet. Just the faintest hint of a dry woodsiness on the finish. Malty, fruity, yeasty, and lightly alcoholic...just what I look for in this style. The label says that the barrel-aging of this beer (for over a year) takes place in well-used ale-aging barrels; this suggests why there's not a lot of oak present in this ale; I think the barrel-aging must have been done primarily for mellowing and perhaps to add just a bit of the tart/sour fruity character. At any rate, it seems to have worked well. 		Mouthfeel: Medium-heavy; warming alcohol 		Drinkability: 1 ""Victorian Pint"" will be just perfect; not to say this isn't highly drinkable; it's just a style you want to savor and enjoy, not slam down. This is not one I'd drink regularly, but rather makes a great ""special occasion"" sipping-beer, perfect for when the days start to grow shorter and the weather colder. 		Conclusion: This is a very nice English Strong Ale/Old Ale. It's very ""English"" in style, with the fruity/malty/alcoholic notes accentuated with very little in the way of hops. It's dead on for the style, and quite tasty. The one real detriment is that it's not exactly cheap; a 550ml typically costs around $12.99 and is fairly difficult to find. Thanks to an awesome trade with ""Beertracker"" and a later lucky find on my part, I have two of the 2008 vintage. One I drank tonight; the other I think I might save for awhile. At any rate, another great beer from Old Brewery Tadcaster. Is anyone surprised?		Additional point: This paired very well with a nicely-aged Mimolette cheese.",2009-10-06 04:20:14

8.5,52828,147,Kona Coffee Macadamia Coconut Porter,American Porter,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,Pagzzz,3.5," Served in a tulip glass @ cellar temp		Appearance: Inky black with one finger head that dissipates quickly to a thin ring. 		Aroma: Coffee big up front (could smell it seconds after cracking the top). Very slight acidic note, probably from deep roasted malts. Touch of nuttiness but tough to pick up coconut. Sweet alcohol notes evident.		Taste: Big roasted malt dominates, but coffee notes are right up front too. Acidity reminds me of ... tabasco?!? Some real complex flavor interactions going on here. Still not getting much coffee or coconut flavors. Hops are shoved out of the way on this one in terms of flavor, but some moderate bitterness. 		Mouthfeel: actually pretty light on body for a robust porter of this strength. 		Overall, it's a tasty brew, but could definitely benefit from the rounding out around the edges that a few years in the cellar should provide.",2009-10-06 04:24:25
5.4,760,252,Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier,Kristalweizen,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,generallee,5.0," Presentation: It was poured from a brown 500ml bottle into a Weizen glass. There is no freshness date on the label but there is a bottle number 0079 on the back label.		Appearance: The body has a clear golden color with lots of beautiful carbonation steaming up to the surface. The pour produced a very tall, aggressive and tight foamy head. It has a bright white color with great retention and lacing.		Smell: Its nose is full of fruity yeast with notes of banana and clove. There are notes of pale beady wheat as well and just a touch of citrus.		Taste/Palate: The flavor is very bright and fresh with plenty of fruity yeast. There are notes of banana, clove and a slight hint of citrus fade into dry crisp wheat malt notes. The finish is very crisp and snappy with some wheat tang and citrus quickly leaving the tongue. The body has a solid medium feel with cleansing active carbonation.		Notes: This was my first Kristalweizen and I was very impressed with the bright clean flavor and good solid yeast flavor. There was much more yeast character than I was expecting in this crystal clear German wheat beer.",2009-10-06 04:25:53
7.5,51550,3521,Van Twee (w/ John Mallett),Belgian Dark Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,RRC87,4.0," Appearance: Pours a dark almost opaque. Has a minimal head, which has great retention.	Smell: Has a mild sour taste with a strange funk that is like nothing I have ever experienced before.	Taste: Starts out with a mild hint of caramelized malt, which proceeds to an overwhelming taste of sour cherries (which only makes since). The funk that was so prevalent in the aroma is reduced to a supporting role that can only be detected in the after taste.	Mouth feel: I was surprised by how carbonated this was for how dark it is. This beer is very dry and leaves the drinker almost thirstier than they were before drinking.	Drinkability: This beer is fairly drinkable. It would be impossible to drink this beer quickly or for an extended period of time, but a bottle a night would be extremely doable.",2009-10-06 04:26:28
5.3,108,35,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,medic25,2.5," First impressions are good; cloudy wheat-gold color with a pillowy white head. The nose is a little off-putting; wheat, with a strong air of unpleasant cherry-robitussin scent. Taste is initally very poor; like a bitter cherry pill. The wheat seems to become a little more evident after the first few sips, but it's still nothing special. The beer has a bitter, medicinal aftertaste that lingers after each sip. Definitely the weak link in the sampler pack.",2009-10-06 04:27:39
4.8,22557,6372,Major Tom's Pomegranate Wheat,Witbier,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,wiseguy142,4.5," Nice color, not too pale but shy of amber with a nice frothy white head on top with a good amount of lacing. 		Nice crisp aroma of wheat- not quite the flavor from wheat you get but also probably partially because of the yeast strain. Really actually seems like a witbier although there's nothing on the bottle that hints at that.		I think the taste is just 1 ingredient shy of being amazing. I don't know what that ingredient is, but it's missing. Great refreshing wheat character, subtle fruit flavor from the pomegranate but no overly juicy flavors. The fruit goes very well with the beer. Very balanced- great level of bitterness and maltiness but yet it's so light.. this is actually very very good. Hops are almost piney, almost noble, but neither of both. 		This is one of the better fruit-wheat beers I've had. I wasn't expecting much. I even though this was going to be old and stale, but it tastes quite fresh.",2009-10-06 04:30:32

Chocolate, roasted malts and some alcohol encompass the smell of this one, very good.		Great taste, chocolate a sight sweet fruity taste with a coffee finish, this is an amazing and complex beer. So much going on with this one.		Beer is very smooth and has appropriate carbonation for an RIS.		Overall, great beer and my Brother in Law and I are making plans to get out to the DLD next year to get a few bottles of this.",2009-10-06 04:31:27

I would say I could drink it all night, but with the alcohol content, I'm not sure it'd be wise to have more than two. Fantastic beer with both sweet and dark flavors.",2009-10-06 04:32:53
8.75,39057,9629,Imperial Black Cherry Porter,Baltic Porter,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,OChaos,3.5," Picked this up at the brewery June 08... Finally shared with Dad and Big Port today..		Great appearance, dark as a stout, pours nice with a light tan head.		Great black cherry and chocolate malt aroma. Black cherry smell is nice on the nose with the chocolate following close behind.		Taste is much like the smell, nice cherry front with chocolate in the middle and a sweet cherry finish, this beer is much better then the carob stout I tried before.		Mouthfeel is a 5 for 5, nice think beer with appropriate carbonation for the style. 		Overall, I was really happy with this one, as it warms the flavor is really coming out of this one. As I mentioned before, the carob stout really let me down and this beer makes up and more, would recommend to anyone.",2009-10-06 04:34:28
4.1,51464,29,Bud Light Golden Wheat,Herbed / Spiced Beer,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,mistascott007,3.0," Poured from bottle.		Appearance: Cloudy golden with active bubbles and thin head that dissipates within a few minutes. Looks like a Hefeweizen -- plenty of unfiltered yeast.		Smell: Sweet and citrusy. Overall pleasant.		Taste: I expected Bud Light with a little tweak but this tastes like a different beer. Nice sweet taste. A bit watery and uneventful but 10 times better than a regular Bud Light.		Mouthfeel: Syrupy aftertaste but goes down smooth. High carbonation -- expected with wheat beer but perhaps too high. A little sticky on the tongue.		Drinkability: High. This beer is refreshing, light, and smooth.		Budweiser markets this as a slightly tweaked Bud Light, but it is an entirely different beer.",2009-10-06 04:35:57
,52805,1114,Undead Ed,American IPA,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,corby112,4.0," Pours ruddy and hazy dark burnt orange color with dark golden orange hues when held to a light source and a .5 finger white head that quickly fades into a lasting ring. The cloudiness makes it pretty much completely opaque with only the slightest bit of pale edges.		The aroma of this beer is pretty complex with a good balance of dry sour bretty efervescent funk and floral citrus hops. There is a nice malt backbone as well but that doesn't take away from the hops too much. Also, there is a good amount of lemon peel and grapefruit but all of these aromas are blended together to form something truely unique.		Creamy full body that is kind of chewy with a lot of dry sweetness up front from the brett and the citrus flavor of the hops. This beer is not very bitter at all. In fact the dry bitterness of the regular Edgar is nowhere to be found. Rather it is replaced again by a dry sweet floral presence as well as some lemon peel and grapefruit. The dry piny xcharacter does come thorugh in the finish however along with a nice dry tart brett character. It's almost as if it has some west coast IPA flavors(mostly the floral and citrus notes) without tasting very hoppy or bitter. Also, it is not very sour, rather sweet and dry. It's almost like the combining of the wild ale and DIPA styles have balanced each other out very well creating something completely new. 		If you are a fan of big chewy dank resnious hoppy IPAs you will be disapointed as well as if you are a fan of tart funky sours. This beer fits neither of tose descriptions but is a weird hybrid of the two styles. I suggest going into it with an open mind.",2009-10-06 04:36:56
5.0,37367,368,U.S. Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,danielharper,3.5," Appearance: Slightly hazy yellow body (a tinge of orange) with a thin white bubbly head that sticks around for a bit. Not bad for an APA, but I usually expect a bit more red. 		Smell: Pale maltiness, piney citrus hops. 		Taste: Much like the aroma, a strong citrus flavor with a hint of dry piney hops on the finish and a dry aftertaste. This is better when it's a bit colder. Almost reminds me of a lager at times.		Mouthfeel: Thin body, heavy hops, moderate carbonation. Actually quite pleasant. 		Drinkability: This is a bog-standard APA. Worth drinking, but nothing special.",2009-10-06 04:39:45

Appearance-dark brown to black, decent hazy head foams up, active carbonation gushes through the glass, it's ok.		Smell-bready as expected, a whoosh of alcohol and plenty of hops. Lots of aroma. 		Taste/Mouthfeel-hops hit with a flourish, piney taste, bready character to the beer, not really tasting anything that distinct that would make me realize it's a rye, but still a great tasting beer. 		Drinkability-I had no trouble finishing mine, strong beer but definitely drinkable.		Overall-once again, I couldn't really determine that it was rye based on the taste alone, but still, this is a great beer from a brewer that I've really come to respect.",2009-10-06 04:42:07

10.0,50331,158,15th Anniversary Wood Aged,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,PhxHorn,4.0," This one pours a deep reddish brown color with a quarter inch white head which quickly dissipates. There is very little aroma, and I stuck my nose right down on it, but there is a hint of citrus. It tastes moderately of sweet citrus, caramel, with a sticky mouthfeel. Not all that intense or complex for a DIPA. Just a little on the thin side for this style, though an IPA would have been believable. Very drinkable in that you don't really taste the alcohol, but you do eventually feel it.",2009-10-06 04:54:36
5.5,48222,2240,Coconut Joe,Milk / Sweet Stout,5.0,4.5,3.5,3.0,DavoleBomb,4.5," This review used to be from notes taken at the bar, but the review was lost in the recent data crash. This one is from memory.		Had this at Papago Brewing. Poured into an English pint glass from tap.		5.0 A: Quite a looker. Typical stout, super black color. Two fingers of the creamiest head I've ever seen, which is tan/cream in color and had great retention and tons of lacing.		4.5 S: Chock full of coffee. This was the most coffee I've ever gotten from a beer. At first I didn't pick up on the coconut because it blends in so well, but after a few more snifts I did notice it and it gets stronger as the beer warms.		4.5 T: Absolutely delicious. It tastes just like a carbonated bitter cup of black Joe. Really, it does. The coconut isn't as strong in the taste. In fact, most of it is lost.		3.0 M: Light-medium body. This could be much creamier. This is the only bad aspect of the brew. The mouthfeel just flat out sucks.		3.5 D: Picture perfect looks, awesome smell, and very tasty, but the drinkability suffers a hell of a lot from the mouthfeel.",2009-10-06 04:56:54
5.0,38467,467,Summit Pilsener,Czech Pilsener,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,cokes,3.5," Golden hued topped with a modest, dying white froth.	It smells dryly of hay and grass and crusty breads.	It begins with that same crusty breadiness, with notions of something slightly sweeter. Hay sweeps in, then is washed clean with an interlude of lagered briskness. The hop finale is lightly floral, more forcefully grassy and plenty dry.	Medium-light bodied with a fading carbonation.

The crackers are first through the mouth. Dry throughout, but a bit of apple sweetness peeks out. Hay through the middle, then emphatic floral hop ring out. Lots of lingering flower petal bitterness with some grassy pulpiness.	Light bodied, beginning highly carbonated, but petering out as it rests. 	This might be over hopped per the style and lacks the quaffability and balance of some of the more refined versions. Though it makes more of a statement than most.",2009-10-06 05:10:11

Java nose, with the creamy, flaky oatmeal as a pronounced secondary aroma, along with cocoa nibs, and grain.	Roasty up front and throughout. Coffee beans and bitter chocolate. Oats bring their creamed graininess, and stay awhile. Low hop profile, but the counteracting (and complementary) bitterness is there.	The nitro brings a fleecy full body upfront, which sags over the sip and thins a great deal. 	I'd like to see a fuller, non-nitro version bottled, because it has a lot of upside, but the current situation is akin to an oated Guinness. Good session stout, but a bit hollow.",2009-10-06 05:16:31

15.0,47506,1471,Three Guy Off The Scale Barley Wine,American Barleywine,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,PEBKAC,4.5," (Mixed scored. Edit at the bottom.)		The more recent 15% version, though I believe this bottle had a year or two on it(wax top). Courtesy of the ugly duckling. Thanks dude. :)		Bottle was hesitantly passed around right after everyone had flopped over in there seat to digest some tasty, greasy grey matter.		Into my heavy duty snifter, after just barely finishing off our opening round. Maybe not the best choice, but it did prove to be easier to down then expected.		A faded scotch color, with an expected similar lack of head. A nice swirl to it starting up, but it pretty much layed there.		Smell is overall muted, but what does come through is medicinal. Hot alcohol, fruit wood, & flagrant spots of plastic.		Taste was worlds better. Warm earthy fruit, brandy, a little leather, & a bigger bit of slightly sharp citric bitterness.Finish was composed of toasty/crusty malt & very mild bittersweet fruit residuals. It never became overly bitter or syrupy. It delivered a very warm sensation without ever getting hot or pushing forward a headache sweetness.		We came off pretty impressed by the feel, which was not at all oozy or even more then adequately thick. Even as an English-style barley wine, it did not over impose & put us into a coma. Instead, much fruit & rind came through, all in between soft & succulent. Never really sharp, although it did edge in close with it. Alcohol was evident, but never hostile, which for the ABV, earned more then just a wow.		Nothing approaching harsh. A very mellow & almost juicy barley wine, which doesn't quite make sense, but it is what it is. My overall score really should add up to be higher. :)		Edit 01/29/11: Just popped an unwaxed vintage, & the alcohol has completely died. Looking a bit thicker & murkier, it surprisingly drank like it was in single digits. Fruit was bigger on the nose then previous & no ugly plastic. Drinkability suffered with less carbonation, but overall, an improvement on what was already an impressive brew. Thanks again Black Swan. :)",2009-10-06 05:26:37
6.0,1917,192,La Folie,Flanders Red Ale,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,cokes,4.0," Blood red with chestnut hues and a solid beige rise on top. 	Sour cherry nose, with oak traits, and a variety of fruit punch sweet-sourness, emphasizing pineapple. 	Sour Patch Kids in the mouth. A bit of toasty graininess is dispatched right away. Then it is all vague tropical fruit doused it forceful tartness. Cherries, pineapple, lime juice, white grapes, and balsalmic vinegar. Oak brings tannic sour woodiness on the tail.	Full bodied, with a syrupy feel that grips the mouth with its acrid sour juice. 	It lacks a bit of sweet counterweight of many Flanders ales, but sour heads should seek this out ASAP.",2009-10-06 05:27:50
4.9,53151,961,Schmucker Bio-Pils,German Pilsener,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,CAMRAhardliner,3.5," Cool Hessian looking guy on the label. I like the old-school, campy labels you find on a lot of German beers.		The pour reveals a slightly hazy straw liquid with a fluffy, long lasting head that leaves a tremendous amount of lace on the glass. The aroma is of herbal slightly minty hops and a grainy maltiness. The first sip shows a good amount of earthy hop flavor with a sea air saltiness. Bready malts balance out the hops and with some warmth, overpower them. The finish is lightly bitter and quite herbal. The mouthfeel is vigorously carbonated and light bodied.		This is a pretty nice Pils. It has a good amount of hop flavor, and a nice malt balast. Perhaps it could be a little more bitter and fresher or 'juicier' in the hop profile. Still worth a try for sure.",2009-10-06 05:30:17
7.5,28877,13307,Beer Geek Breakfast,American Double / Imperial Stout,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,jdklks,4.0," pours very dark for what seems to me would be classified as a regular (not imperial) stout. an almost non-existent brown head of exceedingly thin bubbles. the smell is primarily of coffee and roasted malts, with a complimenting cherry sweetness. it would be much better if it was more intense. 		The flavor is largely characterized by an intense roasted bitterness, though a little cherry sweetness sneaks in at the beginning and into the aftertaste. coffee and roasted malts reminiscent of dry, bitter dark chocolate dominate. there is, surprisingly enough, a slight alcohol tinge in the back of the mouth and esophagus. a very robust and good [regular] stout, but a little dull for an imperial. still, a good beer. 		if they're going to call it an imperial, im going to rate it like and imperial, and here the mouthfeel is thin and tingly. pretty good drinkability.",2009-10-06 05:30:31
8.5,7463,1199,Founders Dirty Bastard,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,4.0,4.5,3.5,3.5,whynot44,4.5," Nice clear mahogany color with a decent light tan head that retains fairly well and produces a bit of nice lacing. 		The aroma is sweet caramel malt, toffee, plums, coffee and hints of smoke. 		The taste is also a blast of maltiness -caramel, toffee, brown sugar, coffee, maybe a bit of dark chocolate and fruit. The finish is slightly dry with notes of dark toast, coffee, pine needles and a definite alcohol kicker. 		Medium bodied, fairly smooth, drinkable but more suited to after dinner on a cold winter day. Almost a winter warmer.",2009-10-06 05:32:42
11.0,50846,63,Black Butte XXI,American Porter,4.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,Beaver13,3.0," 22 oz bottle, best after 10/17/10 (oh well!). Pours a dark brown with a creamy tan head that retains well and laces the glass.		The aroma is sweet roasted chocolate, tar, black licorice, and coffee. A little too heavy on the black licorice and tar for me.		The flavor is sweet sugary lactic chocolate balanced by a big tarry roasted bitterness and black licorice with a little coffee. The finish has a good deal of bitterness. As it warms, the sweetness comes out and becomes a bit overwhelming. Also notes of bourbony dark fruits appear as well. It's very bold but not at all smooth - a bit too brash for me. The mouthfeel is fairly full with creamy carbonation.		Overall, it's a bit too harsh especially with the black licorice and tar and then the heavy sweetness. It would be interesting to try again after the best after date to see if it mellows out.",2009-10-06 05:35:30
5.5,43929,29,Michelob DunkelWeisse,Dunkelweizen,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,EagleTalon,4.5, Pours a dark red-amber color with generous head and (if you do a traditional pour) cloudiness. Aroma is banana cream and caramel malt. Flavor is a traditional hefeweizen with a generous caramel and slight roast maltiness (very nice) with a nice touch of German hops. Finishes fruity and malty. Nice carbonation and mouthfeel. A very good beer.,2009-10-06 05:38:36
7.9,52142,140,Sierra Nevada Belgian Trippel,Tripel,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,cokes,4.0," Clear deep golden with a tight stack of white foam.	Honeyed aroma of apricot, pale malt, raw sugar, pear, and coriander (though not in the actual, spiced Witbier sense).	It enters with a sugared notion of grain in the mouth. Sweet breads and honeyed grain. Fruitiness ensues with papaya, banana, and apples. Yeast brings a small dash of peppers and cloves. Hops add a counterpuncual grassy bitterness, but are on the light side overall. Alcohol is hardly noted. This stays sweet more than anything.	Heavy bodied, pushing toward cloying but never arriving there. The CO2 levels are minor, and die over time, which seems par for many US tripels. 	Its definitely on the sweet, Americanized, side of the style, but is pleasant, nuanced, and drinkable despite its girth.",2009-10-06 05:38:48
10.0,634,201,De Dolle Bos Keun,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,dasenebler,4.5," A tricky but beautiful pour. Had to do it in two doses into a big tulip glass. Copious, no... mountainous, no.... volcanic head. I thought Duvel had a big head. Man. Big clumpy lacing. Hazy amber-orange with some swirly yeast. 		Aroma is big and fruity with lots of vinous character. Kind of funky, though this mellows out. Pear and apricot.		Flavor is similar to aroma, and equally fruity and complex. Lots of yeasty, estery flavors. Getting more apple in the flavor. Sweet, but not cloying. Aftertaste is somewhat bitter, dry. Carbonation appears high, but is actually very fine, contributing to the rich, creamy texture of this beer. You can taste the alcohol, but for ten percent, it is very well mitigated in this beer. A sipper, but oh, so smooth.		This is delicious, warming beer. High-marks all around.",2009-10-06 05:44:33
7.0,18721,651,Cascazilla,American Amber / Red Ale,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,emsroth,4.5," 12oz bottle		App: Huge 2-3 finger, tan head. Deep reddish amber in color. Devilishly dark and opaque. Makes you think it's truly from a monster. 		Smell: Fruity north american hops dominate. I am reminded of unripe peaches and strawberries. I detect a faint, malty undertone; it smells like sweet, dark bread. This is a nice touch to a hoppy beer, because as we know, they malt rarely ever gets through.		Taste: Greeted by a rush of carbonation and a touch of sweet, indistinguishable malt. Then on to the main show: the hops! Their flavor is mostly pine with a hint of citrus bite. Not the most flavorful, but such a wonderful bitterness. As it warms, undertones of apples seep out. The aftertaste is mostly bitter and floral, but it does have the occasional malty chew.		Crisp medium body and carbonation that is as biting as the hops. 		It's a rough brew, and certainly challenging to the palette. Monstrously hoppy with out being overbearing in anyway. A genuinely delicious brew.",2009-10-06 05:45:10
4.2,17141,1549,312 Urban Wheat,American Pale Wheat Ale,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,emsroth,4.0," 12oz bottle with freshness date.		App: Beautiful straw colored with visible suspended solids. Haze is good, but seeing the solids is a little weird. 		Smell: Malty and fruity, like a fruit salad that has been squired with lemon juice for preservation. The fruitiness comes from the yeast and the hops.		Taste: A rather uniform taste throughout. Husky malt is tasted on the flanks of the palette.		Medium bodied with refreshing carbonation. Mostly quenches my thirst.		Light and refreshing, how I like my APWA's, but just an average brew.",2009-10-06 05:49:48
7.85,49351,140,Sierra Nevada Brown Saison,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,cokes,3.5," Dark tanned hide bodied with a close-cropped beige dome with decent lacework and retention. 	Toasted grain nose, pushing darker with cocoa and anise, with backing spiciness of orange, coriander, and black pepper. Some juniper-y notes of gin occur, only partially due to the alcohol.	The toasted grain malt profile pushes into the mouth first. Bready and static for a while, with some minor spice incursions of blood oranges and coriander and blck peppercorns. Turns a tad tarter with pink grapes and liquorice. Hops are lowly and add only a spicy, herbal dryness. Alcohol is present in a background gin-fueled, juniper-laden flare.	It's sort of like a fattened, toasty witbier more than any sort of saison. And lacks any true yeasty farmhouse character.	It carries medium-plus body with a subdued carbonation. It drinks smaller than it is, and drink enjoyable, but it doesn't drink all that interesting.",2009-10-06 05:52:10
5.0,53152,2675,Blackberry Heiferbison,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,BDTyre,3.5," Decent summer beer from Phillips - something new and a bit different. Shocking cloudy red that looks like a blood orange and a frothy pinkish head.		Surprisingly, the smell is mostly wheat malt. Slightly bitter-sweet, with a very low hop character. The blackberries lend a somewhat sour taste to it and scent to it.		The blackberries are a bit more noticeable in the flavour, but still the wheat malt is quite noticeable. Could use a bit more tweaking, but not bad. Quite decent considering how widely any blackberry beer can vary in terms of taste.		Great summer sipper, not quite a session but maybe....",2009-10-06 05:53:48

Toasty nose, backed with peppery rye, cocoa, banana, vanilla, and clove. It brings a solid rye persona mixed with a hefeweizen petigree.	It's doughy on its onset in to the mouth, toasty, peppery, and warm, as the rye makes itself know right off the bat. It darkens for a moment with cocoa and anise Weizen yeast brings a huge load of cloves, bananas, lemon, and vanilla. Toastiness and spicy rye resumes on the backend. Hops add tracers of herbal, grassy dryness.	Medium bodied, with a gradually receding CO2. 	It's basically a bastardized hefew(rye)eizen. And there are not many like this made in the states or anywhere. Rye heads should run at this.",2009-10-06 06:02:27

Smell: Not what I was expecting given the appearance. Nice mix of fruit, mild clove, banana.		Taste: Pleasant mix of half tripel, half pale ale/english ipa. Slightly spicy hoppiness without any citrus notes.		Mouthfeel: Thin, very carbonated. Exceptionally crisp.		Drinkability: Well balanced. None of the flavors weigh too heavily. Very easy drinking. Almost too easy for a beer that is nearly 8% abv. (BA shows this at 7.3%. 12oz bottle bottled on 8/6/09 is marked as 7.8%)",2009-10-06 06:07:25

The aroma is a pleasant combination of rich dark and milk chocolate. It's reminiscent of a truffle, with dark fruit notes. I get a touch of coffee, but just a touch. Booze is also at a low level. The chocolate component is very nice.		The beer opens with a balance of dark and milk chocolate and a welcome dash of coffee that lingers in the background. Bitterness is at a moderate level, and sweetness is at a low moderate level. Very nice.		The beer is full bodied with low medium draft carbonation and a creamy, silky mouthfeel. This is a 4.5 drinkability if you're in the mood for a big rich drink. On a day such as this the beer is a 4.0 for me.",2009-10-06 06:12:47
5.1,30764,13014,Coffee Bender,American Brown Ale,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,cokes,4.5," Served in the ""It's never too early to be Surly"" ""coffee"" cup.	Dark mahogany brown with a thick crop of tan lace.	Toasted hazelnut aroma with a backing (or, fore-ing) of medium roast beans. The coffee shows a great deal of nutty, roasty, easrthy complexity. I'm a coffee nut, and I'd love to have it as my daily grind. 	Across the tongue, it gives that mildly toasty, roasty, grainines of Bender, with hazelnut nuance. Coffee usurps the usual foward hoppiness, and brings medium roast, oily beans. These linger teasingly into the close. I really like these fucking beans. Mild, complex, earthy, nutty, and a perfect compliment to the beer itself.	The oiliness of the coffee thins the beer a bit vis a vis the original. But for a bean head, this is drinkable from sun up to sun down. 	This is one of the best coffee beers I've had, and equal kudos go to Surly and the roaster. The result is a coffee-focused beer that is harmonized with the beans it is juiced with.",2009-10-06 06:17:28
7.7,4083,147,Stone Ruination IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,HopHead84,4.5," Consumed on 9/29/2009 on tap at Stone. The beer is copperish orange with a fluffy white head. Retention and lacing are both decent, and that's all I'm going to say on the subject.		The beer was served ice cold. It seriously seemed like it was in the low thirties. I couldn't smell anything for nearly 25 minutes. If there's some point in serving a craft beer that cold, I'm missing it. At about the 30 minute mark the nose opens up and reveals orange pith, pine, and grapefruit. It's all very dry, and malt imparts a low level of caramel. Tropical notes become apparent with further warming.		The beer is very dry with an upper moderate level of bitterness. It tastes of bitter grapefruit, orange pith, and pine resin. Caramel notes are quickly overrun by the delicious hops. The finish is very, very dry.",2009-10-06 06:20:02
5.0,571,113,Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout,Oatmeal Stout,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,TheMadJack,4.5," Poured from 18.7 oz. bottle into mug.		Beer is dark brown and almost completely opaque. The head crests a full inch and settles to about a third. Foamy, sticky, toffee colored head with some lacing.		The beer smells like a caramel apple - heavy, syrupy caramel notes over sweet and sour fruityness. Roasted coffee notes come through behind.		Flavor is roasted coffee, caramel, and toast. Slight bitter finish, like a good espresso. The beer doesn't linger overmuch, but fades out without any hurry. The beer takes on a creamy note as it warms, and the coffee becomes more pronounced. Dark chocolate comes through on the finish as well.		This is one smooth beer. Gently carbonated, slightly foamy, with a flowing, creamy mouthfeel. Almost like drinking milk. Wonderful, beery milk. Like mother used to make, or would have if God had been thinking properly. I digress.		This beer is a pleasure to drink. While not exactly ""session"" material, it's easy to drink and I could see having several over the course of a long evening.",2009-10-06 06:24:24
5.1,44531,13014,Hell,Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,cokes,3.0," Lightly hazed yellow bodied with traces of white lace on top.	Doughy aroma spiked with peppery hops and crushed pill astringency.	Doughy again on its onset in the mouth. Wet bready and generally bland. More bread and more wet and more bland as it rests a while with no real lagered clarity. Hops bring herbs, florals, and, especially astringency, in a smashed Tylenol sense, twisted with lemon. 	Doughy, wet, fatty, and plump through the gullet with no relief from the stunted CO2. 	The astringency prevents an otherwise pedestrian brew from achieving its goals. If they tried to hop it up, it failed. If they're looking for mass appeal, look again. 	This just isn't very good.",2009-10-06 06:29:13

A-- Poured black, not as dark as the doubles or RIS's I have had. A dark brown head with an inch of head leaving a good lacing on the glass. Good carbonation but this is also a lighter porter. My bottle is 4.8 ABV.		S-- Chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and sugar to this. Great smell to this. Already has my mouth watering to this.		T-- Roasted malts and chocolate. Some coffee taste but does not dominate like the bigger versions are doing. A bit thin but have been drinking a lot of RIS and doubles of later so that will hurt a bit. Like a thin chocolate milkshake.		M-- more carbonation so it is more lively, also not as creamy but it has character in the finish as the chocolate and coffee become more apparent. The malts are more forward in this and the coffee and chocolate secondary.		D-- A session porter. Plain and simple. Great flavor and can drink anytime of year. A great beer that is not in the ABV cat of over 7%. The strength in this is how drinkable it is.		 Over time this has replaced 90 shilling as my favorite beer. It does not leave you full and can drink several and not get tired of this. If this was an RIS it would be too big I think. It is perfect the way it is. this was the beer that got me into the bigger stuff because of the body and weight of the beer. This still has it but it is toned down but it has all the ingredients that makes it stand out. Why I like Odell beers so much. Very simple and good beers.",2009-10-06 06:51:43

Noticable late hop aromas... but then a smell so familiar I couldn't pick it... not a normal beer smell. It took me probably 5 minutes to put my finger on it... the seaweed used in sushi. I kid you not. Maybe it's a briney, glutinous rice character. A nice enough smell if you like that kind of thing (which I do), but not what you'd expect in a German lager. Some biscuity bready notes as well.		And the taste ? Well, at the risk of scorn from my fellow BAs, I'm going to write it as I saw it... A remarkable flavour that you wouldn't expect in a beer. Not unpleasant, but unexpected.... a light hint of BBQ king prawns in the shell. What ?!?! I dunno... maybe there's a caramalised note that's common.. or is there a briney character (also picked up in the nose) ? If you want some ""classic"" descriptors, then I'll throw in light munich biscuit notes, off herbal notes. An awkward late bitterness backs it up.		It has a lightly creamy mouthfeel, finishes smoothly and with some lingering body.		Interesting to say the least.

5.59,28951,13397,Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,Fezfreak,4.5," Here goes folks, my first beer review for BA. Quite honestly, I never pictured myself doing this. But I am a native of West ""by God"" Virginia, and since this beer comes from the only bottling-brewery in the state, I thought I'd take a whack at it...even though it was 3:12am Eastern when I started writing.		Mountaineer Pale Ale reminds me of Lamar Street Pale Ale, a house brand of Whole Foods, produced by Goose Island that I used to enjoy.		Personally, I don't think they should call this a Pale Ale. To my eyes, shnozz, and palate - this falls somewhere between a Pale Ale and a Pilsner. So I'm not going to review it based on a stringent criteria of how it compares with other Pale Ales. To do that would mean a lower than average review. Instead, let's look at it based on the principle of: ""is it any damn good?""		Yes sir, it is.		It pours to a good thick head that gets a little thin, but hangs in there and leaves a nice lace all the way down the glass. The appearance is on the orange side of copper with a slight and desirable haze (again...falling between a Pale Ale and a Pilsner)		Fans of Pale Ale should prepare to have a lighter, more refreshing version of the style. In some ways better suited for summer, but generally good all year round. Both the smell and taste have sweet, lingering notes of tea, which I kind of like.		This is balanced by what I like to call the ""Cereal Factor"": that wonderful (some say biscuit) characteristic that connects you to the past, reminding you of the origins of beer itself. The very basic essence of what beer is. 		I burned myself out on Pale Ale a long time ago when I became a hophead. Couldn't hardly drink the stuff anymore. Got to the point where I was almost exclusively drinking either IPA or Pilsner - one extreme to another (Stouts and Porters being the ones thrown in for good measure). 		During the last year, I have come back to Pale Ales and am actually enjoying them more. Even so, I do not buy and enjoy Mountaineer Pale Ale based on that, nor for the Pale Ale profile. 		I do it because it's a damn good beer...		...and it's made in my home state!",2009-10-06 07:43:18
5.3,808,252,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,Dunkelweizen,4.0,4.5,5.0,4.5,weazal,4.0," A: Immediately full of heavy spices - mostly clove and malt (yeast after being jostled). Ripe, pungent fruitiness - banana at the beginning turning into slight effervescent apple at the end.		T: Similar to aroma. Spices and dried banana stand out the most. Some well-done caramel sweetness carries through in the back. The body is wonderfully soft and slowly floats through your mouth leaving a juicy, clean finish.",2009-10-06 07:51:47
8.6,52441,147,Stone 09.09.09 Vertical Epic Ale,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,corby112,3.5," Pours pitch black and completely opaque without even th slight touch of amber edges when held to a light source and a 1.5 finger frothy tan head that slowly fades into a lasting ring that leaves sporadic chunks of dark lacing.		Chocolate malt aroma with a peppery spiciness, dark fruit notes, chocolate and vanilla bean, citrus peel and subtle hops. There is a nice roasted character with some hints of burnt toast. Slightly minty with subtle earthy oak.		Chewy fuller end of medium body with a slight roasty smokey maltiness and burnt toast. Lots of silky chocolate with hints of spicy peppery mint as well as some light citrus fruit and earthy oak. There are some subtle dark fruit notes as well with smooth vanilla beans. Slightly yeasty with some bread notes and subtle ripe banana. The tangerine citrus is very subtle are way overpowered by the dominant spice character as well as the darker fruits and roasted malt. Also a bit of alcohol burn warmth in the dry finish. 		This beer is unique and complex but they probably overreached on this one, adding too much to truly appreciate the chocolate covered citrus(tangerine) flavor they were going for. The spice character, especially is way overdone.",2009-10-06 07:59:01
5.5,26234,29,Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale,Pumpkin Ale,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,wknight167,3.0," Apearance - Pours a dark copper with a half finger white head that dissapears quickly.		Nose - Brown sugar,Crystal malt, vanilla, pumpkin and spices.		Palate - Sweet, molasses. A bit of pumpkin and spices, vanilla.		Mouthfeel - pretty light on the carbonation and a bit watery to boot.		Drinkability - Not overpowering in the least, but not too exciting either",2009-10-06 08:28:46
4.8,935,360,Warsteiner Premium Verum,German Pilsener,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,BeerSingh,3.5," Pours golden yellow with a stable, frothy head into a pils glass. Steady jet from the base of the glass is visible. Smells of cookies and bread - malty with end notes of wet grass. Tastes sweet in the beginning and finishes crisp and dry. Good carbonation levels add to an overall happy mouthfeel. Would be a great session beer seriously.",2009-10-06 08:29:38

Light retention afterwards.		Smell - A nice, sweet smell of banana, vanilla, and cloves. Some honey notes too.		Taste - Malty sweetness with mostly banana and vanilla flavor, with honey notes too. Bitterness is basically non-existent. Minimal spiciness. 		Mouthfeel - Super smooth and medium bodied. Light-Moderate carbonation. Very good!		Drinkability - Highly sessionable, with flavor to boot.		Overall - This is probably my favorite Hefeweizen I've had so far, but I still prefer the Franziskaner Dunkelweizen over this. Still a great beer though, and definitely recommended to fans of the style.",2009-10-06 08:32:34
7.5,49789,220,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.5,5.0,5.0,4.5,KickbacksSteve,5.0," Without a shadow of a doubt, my beer of the year for 2009. Loved it when it was totally fresh, love it as it gets a bit older. Very unique taste up front and that great Lagunitas hop onslaught on the back end, balanced but just a nice amount of sweetness. Hard to believe the ABV is over 7% on this masterpiece. Juicy greatness and just a true joy to drink over and over. Glorious.",2009-10-06 08:32:36

Poured a deep dark burgundy red / almost completely black colour... Mocha tan head poured very fairly thick and foamy with a meringue like top.. this faded slowly to good one finger covering... some decent lacing clings to the glass throughout...		Aroma - Lots of good strong toasted bread malts mixed with strong biscuit notes... butterscotch, good roasted nuttiness, dark brown sugar / molasses sweetness, light fruits (blackcurrents, apples, prunes), earthy, some sooty traces...		Taste - Pretty much as above only slightly toned down... hops more noticeable - some grassy and peppery notes... good bitterness coming through from the roasted malts...		Feel - Sharp and dry with a little creaminess underneath... medium bodied... at only 5% this is a very drinkable brew...		Overall - A supremely well balanced porter... definitely recommended...",2009-10-06 08:34:10
11.0,47151,3818,Oak Aged Unearthly (Imperial India Pale Ale),American Double / Imperial IPA,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,scruffwhor,4.0," Pours a bright, yet dark copper color with a very very quick head. No foam or bubbles, but a light syrupy look to it. The aroma is a sharp lemony hop, some carameled biscuits, with some toasted oak brandy aromas. Complex and bittersweet aromas. The taste starts with sweet toasted malts with some oakey, earthy hops. The middle is a little syrupy on the palate with a warm alcohol that thins out the oaken IPAS barrell flavoring a little. But also adds som depth with the heat as well. Bitter is underlying the sweetness of his IPA. Very nice and sippable.",2009-10-06 08:34:27
4.4,1321,75,Modelo Especial,American Adjunct Lager,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,BeerSingh,3.0," Had it at the Bkini Beach Bar in Atlantic City, there wasn't anything more worthy to order anyway. Wasn't terribly disappointed though. Poured bright golden with a thin head that almost immediately disappeared. Smelt of grain and vinegar. Tasted quite bland (unmalty) and bitterish towards the end with a thin, almost waterlike mouthfeel, except carbonation was reminding me that its beer you were drinking. I would rate it big on drinkability for its smoothness.",2009-10-06 08:51:18
10.5,39621,423,The Sixth Glass,Quadrupel (Quad),4.0,4.0,3.0,2.5,caligreen,4.5," Pours a bit thin for a quadrupel, and has a cloudy dark amber color. It gives off notes of nutty-caramel scents. The head builds quickly but disappears relatively quickly. The warming sensation from the alcohol comes on a bit strong, even considering the 10.5%. The aftertaste has a bit more of a metallic taste than I would like. A similar brew I would say is similar in style but a more well-crafted ale is Affligem.",2009-10-06 08:51:53
10.0,2874,870,Old Blarney Barleywine,American Barleywine,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,saintwarrick,4.5," This brew pour a nice cloudy dark red or light brown with a sweet aroma, lots of brown sugar, bourbon and a boozy strong alcohol smell. Not at all like an American barleywine, more like a strong ale or the like. Taste follows that pattern, with a deep thick malty character that is cut by a distinctive American hop presence, though it's not as strong as most American barleywines. This is more of an English barleywine that just happens to have U.S. hops. Alcohol is well reserved in the taste despite the boozy aroma.		A very good brew, even if the style is a little erratic. A must try for barleywine lovers.",2009-10-06 08:52:09

The newest trappist brewery, with the smallest output (even less than westvleteren!!)....let's see Poured into an original Achel glass. The beer pours a nice brown-amber color with a thick, very creamy head that offered good lacing during drinking.		Smell: Clear roasted malts, citrus fruits, yeast, spicy hops and some brown sugar.		Taste: Roasted malts again, caramel, raisins and/or prune, citrus, the beer is slightly sour as well (cherrie) with some well balanced bitterness in the end.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with medium carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink.		Overall: I like this trappist, it is clearly different from all others. Perfectly balanced and very easy to drink. Recommendable.",2009-10-06 09:54:28
4.5,16971,281,Tsingtao Premium,American Adjunct Lager,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,BeerSingh,3.5," Had it at Tony Cheng's in Chinatown, DC. Poured a starw golden colour with no head, no lacing in a collins glass (yes, collins !!). Smell was nice and floral - yes, hops have been used, albeit sparingly. Taste was sweety and malty with a bitter finish. Overall, it left a vanilla essence flavour in your mouth. Thin on the palate, but a decent beer to have with oriental cuisine.",2009-10-06 10:21:10

S: Smells of dark fruits like raisins and plums and walnuts		T: Little tart with loads of raisins, plums and cherries. Really big and complex taste here.		M: Very silky and optimal carbonation		D: A great beer, to savour - can go on and on - nice and slow. This is a big favorite",2009-10-06 10:35:53

Mocha head poured thick and foamy then faded very quickly to almost nothing - maybe just a light ring around the edge... barely any carbonation bubbles... very light lacing lines...		Aroma - Strong sweet caramel / toffee maltiness mixed with decent woody and oaky notes, marmalade, toasted bread, quite nutty, strong vanilla, stewed fruits (figs, raisin, some overripe banana), banoffee pie, brown lemonade, 		Taste - Good balance of oakiness mixed with toffee and caramel... lots of toasted bread, butterscotch and vanilla, dried fruits (raisins, dates), rum, again some orange marmalade, earthy, light grassy hops...

I poured it into a pint glass.	Appearance: The body is a deep brown almost completely opaque color. The head is relatively small, a finger or so, light tan, very small bubbles, sporatic lacing, ok retention.	Smell: The aromas are roasted malt, earthy hops and toffee.	Taste: The flavors are earth hops, lots of toffee and toast.	Mouthfeel: The body is very thin but has a nice bite.	Drinkabily: This beer is certainly not bad.

9.6,43687,3818,Creme Brulee (Imperial Milk Stout),American Double / Imperial Stout,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,youbrewidrink,4.0," We brought a bottle to dinner party of non-beer drinkers. They were a little apprehensive.		The color was a nice chocolate brown with a lasting light brown head.		The aroma was dead on, rich slightly burnt sugar.		The taste was as close as you could be to eating the dssert and yet still be considered a beer. Not for everyone but a pretty fun concoction.		The mouth feel and drinkability were pretty much in line with any good milk stout.",2009-10-06 11:27:59
7.5,6076,651,Flower Power India Pale Ale,American IPA,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,Slatetank,4.5," I had this on tap at Capone's in Norristown PA, served chilled in a pint. 		A - A lightly hazed golden amber w/ 2.5 fingers of rocky light khaki. Lots of lace, small beading and there is visible carbonation in the beer.		S - A very citrus and yes, floral hop smell w lots of c hops giving a citrus and grapefruit edge w/ a hint of herbs. A very strong hop presence w/ sweet notes in the back -great aroma		M - The feel is bittersweet, crisp w/ an astringent and bitter texture dominating w/ moderate carbonation and mellow resinous texture. An interesting citrus acidity with just enough malt to add to the layers of dry and bitter in the finish		T - The taste is very full of citrus and zest flavors w a grapefruit and lemon peel taste that is bitter w/ a hint of juicy herbal and mild pine elements. The malt flavor gives a light honey-like taste w/ gentle orange and mild bitterness in the taste carries on. The floral part of the beer is more felt in the resinous smooth way the beer sits on the palate and there is a tasty smooth lemon, mango, lime and orange blend even until the finish- packed with flavor.		D - A great Imperial IPA to me - at 8% it is above your normal Amerian IPA in my opinion. I find it smooth grant you and not intensely bitter, but it still makes the cut. The flavor is easy to drink while potent until the last taste. I will definitely have this again, it took 3 tastes to review this. I enjoyed this, but figure at 8.2% it has its limits.",2009-10-06 11:46:17
4.0,53136,6045,English Session Ale,English Bitter,4.0,3.5,4.5,3.5,Kegatron,3.5," This is a re-review due to the original getting deleted in the recent site crash. Originally added to the database and reviewed on 9/29/09. 		Via nitro-tap @ the brewpub on 9/27/09. Served in an oversized mug. 		Pours a clear gold, with a smooth creamy layer of eggshell-white head. This stays rich, leaving some softer looking, yet still thickish swathes of lacing behind. The aroma is sweet with bread and a bit of bright smelling citrus. Fresh cut grassy character as well. It all seems lighter in the nose yet still is able to pack a delicious little punch in the nose. 		The taste is silky toasted malts, with a steady grainy sweetness to it. Green citrus and just enough lightly spicy bitterness balances this out nicely in the back. Pleasant drying finish on this. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a gentle creaminess in the mouth, yet this has enough body to support the flavors. Very, very, easy feeling overall. 		Solid little sessionable offering here, with the hops in particular helping to keep this interesting. Serving this on nitro, for maximum drinkibility, was only the icing on the cake. I could have easily had another mug or two of this.",2009-10-06 11:59:22

Nice scent, some nice dark grains with a nice sweet wheat malt aroma and a hint of pepper/spice. Good taste, deep and rich, a nice dark wheat with a strong pepper aftertaste from the noble hops. Goes down fine, if a little too thick.",2009-10-06 12:01:00
4.8,37361,303,B.B. Dark Bohemia Beer - 1795 Original Czech Lager,Czech Pilsener,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,Slatetank,3.5," I picked this up at Thirsty's in York, PA. Poured chilled from the 500ml into a mug. The bottle label states the abv is 4.8% though.		A - A dark bronze w/ ruby highlights and translucent clarity w/ 2 fingers of cream cap. The lager appears slightly viscous as it is poured and lace clings in a frothy ring, the beer has a bead of fine caliber		S - A creamy caramel nose w/ hints of spiced woody hops and toffee notes round out the aroma		M - A mild creamy feel w/ malty texture bordering on syrupy w/ mild carbonation for the style and caramel nutty lightly spiced semi-sweet finish		T - A caramel toffee malt flavor w/ light toast notes in the back a mild maple note at first w/ a tinge of vanilla and subtle honey and bready yeast flavor. The woody note of sweet and sligthly sappy pervades the taste w/ a maple honey combo of flavors which are lasting w/ a residual sugar note in the finish		D - A tasty lager-certainly not what I would expect- on the sweet side. I like the flavor and w/ the low abv it is easy to quaff. A decent beer, but not a great example of the style IMO.",2009-10-06 12:06:08

The tall, slender flute was filled with a light golden colored liquid, almost straw like. It was clear, with a steady, fine stream of carbo. Head was marshmallow white, smooth and creamy, lasted well and deposited decent lacing on the glass. Aroma was a tad bready, with lots of grassy hops and a hint of sharpness. Body was not quite medium, with lots of carbo airiness and some prickle on the tongue.		Flavor was light on the malt, with a bit of crackery sweetness present. Grassy hops were quite pleasant, being a touch flowery, too. Lingers quite well on the palate; a solid Pils.

A - Very hazy, peachy golden/orange color with one finger of fluffy, bright white head that retained well and deposited a fair amount of lace on the glass.		S - Initial aroma blends spicy, peppery notes with fruity esters suggesting apple and citrus fruit. Hints of clove and basement funk also emerge as the liquid warmed up. Malt base consists of toasted grains and bready notes.		T - Subtly complex with the typical saison attributes: fruity esters, spicy yeast and a hint of pepper and clove. While there is some earthy bitterness in the backend, the finish is actually quite Berliner Weiss-esque with a splash of sourness and a prevalent toasted grainy malt character. 		M - Medium bodied with substantial carbonation and a syrupy texture. Slight sourness with plenty of residual sweetness and a hint of earthy bitterness on the palate.		D - A superb saison, Rare Vos is definitely an excellent representation of the style. I'm realy surprised it took me so long to try this.",2009-10-06 12:12:48

This one was a clear, medium copper color; quite attractive. Though this isn't a Mrzen, this is the color one should be; not dark copper or light golden. Head was thin and fine, a bit off-white, mostly rimming the edges, leaving good lacing. Nose was very mild, with some toasty malt, yet quite light. It had a mostly medium body, with a touch of prickle, yet still ok.		Flavor-wise, light sweetness leads off, with a touch of toast here too. A bit of caramel comes in, and there are some late, light hops showing up. Caramel makes a reappearance after that, though, finishing nicely. A mild and subtle bier, but it really grew on me.

A - Dark brown body with mahogany highlights and one-finger creamy beige/tan head that retained wonderfully and deposited thick, cake-like lacing around the glass.		S - Dry roasted malt and barley with hints of chocolate and coffee. Overall, the aroma is rather subdued.		T - Big roasted character right off the bat with hints of chocolate and coffee, but mostly dry and roasty flavors cut through. Some earthy bitter notes and nutty malt characteristics also emerge, but overall this is a dry, roasty stout.		M - Medium bodied with a smooth, creamy texture resulting in a very soft mouthfeel, albeit perhaps just a tad watery. Dry finish with slight astringency, some residual sweetness and a hint of bitterness on the palate.		D - Pretty good Irish stout overall. Nothing outstanding or overly memorable, but well-done nonetheless.",2009-10-06 12:22:16

A - A light honey-like amber w/ golden hues and thick 2 finger cream head. Thick lace clings and the clarity is lightly hazy		S - A sweet floral nose w/ mild grapefruit and a hint of lemon w/ subtle honey-malt aroma		M - A creamy, dry and sweet citrus feel w/ mild acidity and floral resinous texture w/ soft cask effect. The mellow carbonation as expected is there w/ clean slightlly bitter finish		T - The taste is a sweet creamy flavor w/ lemony and mild pine accents. The flavor has bitterness that seems light and honey-like sweet malts come into the mix in the middle nullifying some of the bitter grapefruit edge and it has slight acidity in the finish w/ a soft malt cushion- the cask makes for a pretty smooth end		D - Crazy easy to drink for an Imperial IPA- never imagined it was 8% until halfway through, that is the beauty of this beer on cask. It my lose a little edge w/ a softer more citrus hop flavor and accentuate the sweet malt, but a very nice cask treatment. I am eager to taste the bottle now.",2009-10-06 12:24:12

Looks as a Hefeweizen should.		S: A bit watery, but very fruity and pleasant. Lemon, orange, banana and other citrus aromas ( possibly hops) are present.		T: Beautiful balance of citrus zest and fruity sweetness! The aftertaste is of light hops and lemon. Bready yeast, banana and possibly coriander, or something similar.		M: High carbonation. Relatively full-bodied and light, a really great mouthfeel.		d: This beer is as drinkable as beers get.",2009-10-06 12:29:00
8.0,35150,1805,Hell's Bock,Maibock / Helles Bock,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,IBUnit63,3.5," This bomber pours with a decent Germanic malt tone - that slightly brown-sugar bock character works well. Solid carbonation; good eggshell-colored head with some retention to speak of. Carbonation works well and moves quickly.		I get a mix of the sweeter, concentrated roasted malt and some more raw grains typical for a Helles. Slight tinny feel here which maybe speaks to the German malt quotient. Hop pine is there but isn't huge.		We have more of the raw grain character on the taste profile. Hop silage indicates some Saaz is in there. A little bit of bock sweetness and concentration shows up and adds a slight boozy touch.		Nice mix of raw malt and deep, sweet bock character keeps the finish even and well-balanced. Not TOO much of a booze character but there's just a little bit.		This does get a little bit heavy, even after the first glass. It's a decent enough package but it's a little much to knock a bomber down.",2009-10-06 12:31:14

A - Hazy burnt orange/copper-colored body with deep amber hues and a slim light tan head that reduced to a patchy film but produced swatches of sticky lace all around the glass.		S - Pungent waft of fresh, wet cone hops, which impart a slightly earthy, herbal character. Some citrus fruit notes are also present. Simcoe hops? Sure smells like it! Malt presence suggests sweet, burnt caramel. A hint of alcohol also creeps into the mix.		T - Wet hops... lots of 'em... with a caramel malt backing and a sugary sweet base. Hops offer herbal notes primarliy, but also hints of citrus and earthy qualities. Mild alcohol notes appear in the backend, then follows with a spicy bitter finish.		M - Medium bodied with an oily texture and sticky mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot-on. Mild alcohol warmth envelopes the palate. Finishes with a dry, lingering assertive hop bite. 		D - A complex and extremely tasty harvest ale, this Bullfrog brew is brimming with fresh hop flavor. This is easily one of the better harvest ales I've encountered in my travels.",2009-10-06 12:38:10

Quite intense but fine carbonation. 3.5		Aroma: Fruity nose, robust blackberries, and winey grapes, with a sweet almost sugary base. The overall aroma is fairly reminicent of port. 3.5		Taste: Sweet flavours up front, definitely lots of dark sweet fruits, more blackberries, with raisins. Hints of vanilla, along with cinnoman, and a touch of syrup. 3		Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy body, with a slightly greasey texture. 3.5		Drinkability: A bit too sweet for my palete but decent interpretation of the style. 3",2009-10-06 12:46:26

There are also clear floral notes. 4		Taste: Crisp refreshing hoppy flavours at the front, with a resiny pine, and lots of citrus. There is a caramel base provided by the malt, that comes through with a sweetness slightly in the middle. It finishes with a massive hoppy bitterness that lingers. 4		Mouthfeel: Light on the palete, with coating feel. The carbonation is lively, giving it a rough texture. 4		Drinkability: A solid IPA in the American style that offers a powerful hoppy taste that lasts to the end. Very drinkable, there is almost no sign of the heavy alcohol content. 4",2009-10-06 12:47:30

No visible carbonation. 3.5		Aroma: Very subtle aromas. There is wheat coming through most strongly, with a mild sweetness. Some yeasty, acidity. 2.5		Taste: The flavours are quite yeasty and distinctly Belgian in style. As with the nose, there is a noticeable wheaty flavour, with some fruity apple acidity. 3		Mouthfeel: Very carbonated, almost overpoweringly so. Verging on heavy bodied. 2.5		Drinkability: Taste like it should be a bottled conditioned beer with the heavy yeast. The drinkability is hinder slightly by the high level of carbonation. All in all, a strange little beer. 3",2009-10-06 12:48:23

I wandered around other areas of the Fest and found this one... I noticed other people reviewed this as a dunkel, but the Kitzmann web says it's a Mrzen, which is the style I felt it to be when enjoying it.		Though served in a lovely, decorated ceramic mug, I was able to espy a regular glass of the suds at the Fa. The bier itself was a clear, medium golden hue. Up top was a light beige head, which was creamy and smooth like mousse. It lasted well, leaving good stick in its wake. Light bready aromas hit the nostrils first, accompanied by some caramel. The medium body was cool, though it had a light prickle along for the ride.		Has light sweetness here, with restrained hints of caramel, plus a welcome touch of a honeyish character. Hops are mildly flowery, lasting well on the palate. Lots of subtle flavors melding here; a real nice brew!

Energetic bubbles have created and are sustaining a two finger cap of manila colored foam that is on the soft and featureless side. Not much lace doesn't help.		Very lightly toasted pale malt is appreciated (unmalted wheat is present too), but orange peel and coriander are on the shy side. Some citrusiness is appreciated... and barely any spiciness. Let's see if SMW can turn things around on the taste buds.		Midsummer White Belgian Style Wheat Ale gives a slightly better accounting of itself where it matters most, although it still isn't a humdinger of a witbier. More of the things that make a wit a wit would weally be wonderful (said in an Elmer Fudd voice). If you like them mildy flavored, you've come to the right beer.		The cereal graininess of the base beer isn't unpleasant at all. Tops notes include a subtle orange juiciness from both sweet and Curacao oranges (can anyone tell the difference in beer?). Coriander adds a faint spiciness that is most apparent on the bitter-sweet-tangy finish, which is probably the best part of the flavor arc. 		For a 5.0% wit, the body/mouthfeel is right about where it needs to be. In other words, it's much closer to light than medium, with a decent amount of sparkly carbonation that tries to inject a modicum of creaminess... and almost succeeds.		Stegmaier Midsummer White is pretty much par for the course for Lion Brewery. It's better than average and makes no major missteps. This isn't a bad warm weather beer if you're looking for a little something extra in the flavor department (compared to a pale lager).",2009-10-06 12:53:09

Light tan head that dissiated a little too quickly. Agree with others that a little better head retention would have been welcome.		S: Not much in the way of ""hop"" aroma but overall sweet smelling with vanilla, nutmeg, and (it took me awhile to identify it) amaretto coming through loud and clear.		T: Caramel malt sweetness at first then a rush of amaretto or almond biscotti cookie laced with nutmeg and vanilla. Very little in the way of hop bitterness. Not much in the way discernable ""pumpkin"" flavor but the sweet malt and spice combination is highly reminiscent of fall weather and pumpkin pie.		M: Great body, round and viscous very appropriate to the intended effect (pumpkin pie). 		D: Very pleasantly surprised by this beer. Perhaps one of the best fall seasonal (pumpkin) beers I've tried. This is definitely a cookie or pie in a bottle going down easy without being cloying or overpowered by bitter cloves or cinnamon spice. A little too sweet to be a session beer (20oz was more than enough) but would definitely serve this at our annual pumpkin carving party as a specialty beer aimed at capturing a moment in time specific to the season.

Lots of grassiness in the aroma, almost sharp in character. Body was slightly under medium, more towards thin but still acceptable. Still, rather smooth on the tongue, all-in-all.		Taste has a touch of a bready character, then goes on to have a fruity, sourish quality. Quite like a green, young bier, fresh from the keg, which makes this one fit right in.

Some suds clings well to the glass. A bit of light malt is in the nose, with a touch of choco and a hint of roast. Near-medium in the body category, it was very passable on the tongue.		There's subtle sweetness here, with roasted, bitter dark choco notes present. A suggestion of florality appears in the dryish finish. Overall, a decent bier.

9.0,49838,10099,Squall IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,BuckeyeNation,3.5," ""It takes a real storm in the average person's life to make him realize how much worrying he has done over the squalls.""		--Bruce Barton		Ferric oxide orange with no hint of haziness so far. Since this ale is bottle-conditioned, the yeast should be entering the glass on the next pour. A barely audible escape of CO2 on crown cracking was not a good sign. A high-altitude pour has produced a smallish slice of sun-bleached sand colored foam that is more bubbly than dense.		The aroma is appropriately Double IPA-like, with less pungent hoppiness than expected. Perhaps the shortage of bubbles is the culprit. If blinded, I would have guessed one or more of the C-hops (orange and grapefruit), but beyond that it would've been hard to say. This brew is dry-hopped? Really?		Maybe it's the bottle-conditioning (actually, the lack thereof), but Squall IPA is not as good as 90 Minute IPA... and 90 Minute is far from my favorite version of the style. Although the mouthfeel takes the biggest hit, the flavor profile takes its lumps as well.		First of all, the alcohol isn't buried as well as it ought to be. Squall has a slight solvent-like vibe that shouldn't be present in a Dogfish Head brew. The malt tastes like sugar cookies drizzled with caramel and the hops are still candided citrus peel-like. Nearly six months in the bottle must have tamed the lupulins to some extent. At least it tastes like it has.		The body/mouthfeel seems smaller than it is thanks to a serious lack of carbonation. The beer isn't flat, but it's in the vicinity. Sorry, but this has to count as a bottle-conditioning failure. Only my penchant for calmer than normal beer keeps the mouthfeel score from falling another notch.		Depending on my mood, American IPA or DIPA is my favorite style of beer. Thus, I tend to give most versions a fair amount of leeway when it comes to scoring. Squall isn't a perfect storm, though. Far from it. It was a good idea Sam, but you didn't quite pull it off this time.		*originally reviewed 10-04-2009. Thanks a million to dyan for a masterful job of retrieval.",2009-10-06 13:27:26

Taste largely follows the smell, but with an unexpected caramel sweetness in the aftertaste that eventually resolves into more hop bitterness. Quite complex, especially for a mass-market lager.

(I listed it as a Scottish Ale because it's malty with a low hop profile, but frankly I don't know what they were going for with this one, so I could be wrong. A brown ale maybe?)		ETA: Looks like someone changed it to an Irish Red Ale. Not sure if I agree. But whatever.",2009-10-06 13:51:51
8.0,633,201,De Dolle Arabier,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.5,thepeter,3.5," A - WOW! What a pour, that took a while and the head is still trying to creep out the bottle . Big fluffy meringue head that leaves decent lacing. Very hazy dark orange in color.		S - Grapefruit, Citrus and various other fruits. Spicy, bit of cloves and maybe some white pepper and yeast, also maybe some bubblegum that adds to the sweetness.		T - spicy, bitter grapefruit rinds, mixed pepper, clove and musk. Not as much sweetness as I expected from the nose, and think it could have used some additional to balance out the bitterness.		M&D - Medium bodied and Very smooth with good carbonation (I had figured it was going to be over carbonated from the pour, but I was wrong). Bubbled up a bit in my mouth but only the first couple of sips. I could drink more but I would have liked it a bit better balanced.",2009-10-06 13:52:57
5.5,101,35,Samuel Adams Winter Lager,Bock,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,Anthony1,3.5," has a nice brownish/amber appearance, filtered. had a nice head that stuck around for most of the beer. smell i found hints of the spices they claim to have, but mainly strong malty presence. taste more of the same as with the smell. mouthfeel is what you would expect as well as the drinkability. certainly a beer made for average beer drinkers, or drinking of high quantities; nothing too stand out here.",2009-10-06 13:54:26
7.3,31551,13371,Wynona's Big Brown Ale,American Brown Ale,3.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,rfgetz,4.5," Pours a hazy dark brown, thinner khaki colored head, decent retention and lacing. Smell is dominated by delicious dark roasted malts, slight earthy, nutty and smokey notes, some faint carmel sweetness is in the back end. Smells bolder than you average brown ale, bordering on porter territory. Taste follows the scent, once again bolder and more assertive than a typical brown ale but not as aggressive as the smell dictates - dark roasted malts, roasted nuts, earthy, slight hints of carmley sweetness. ABVs hidden well. Medium bodied, good carbonation. Another very good brew from Voodoo. Almost infringes on english porter territory with its bolder brown ale profile.",2009-10-06 13:59:33
5.0,53159,765,Trafalgar Hop Nouveau 2009,American Pale Ale (APA),3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,MeisterBurger,3.0," According to the label:		Hops picked: Sept 6, 2009	Brewed: Sept 6. 2009	Bottled: Sept 21, 2009 (unfiltered)	Delivered: Sept 25, 2009		This is no mean feat, especially in Ontario, and I applaud Trafalgar for their efforts and for jumping on the fresh/wet hopped trend...but beyond the novelty factor, what's the point of going to all that trouble if it's only going to lead to a really mediocre beer?		It pours an orangey yellow, with a so-so head and minimal head retention.		The aroma is grassy and grainy. Slight cooked corn.		The taste is grassy and herbal with a weak biscuity grainy malt. Really, it tastes very raw. Very green, like leaves or uncooked green beans with a hint of lemon rind. All sorts of really raw hops are going on, but there's a decided lack of malt to really make it taste like anything but liquid stems.		The mouthfeel was thin and watery.		Overall not a horrible beer but not good enough to get at half the price. Hopefully if there is a Hop Nouveau 2010, having worked out how to brew a wet hopped beer and get it on shelves quickly, they'll change the recipe and produce a beer that is worth the effort.		Oh, and here's yet another label from Trafalgar that looks like it was designed by their receptionist in Microsoft Word over the course of a lunch break.",2009-10-06 14:01:54

Cloudy and hazy dark coppery orange in color. Frothy and fluffy white head, decent retention but lacing suffers. Smell is bready and yeasty, hay and straw, earth. Taste follows scent but in a more assertive yet balanced profile... the yeasty bready flavors balance well with the earthy and straw-like rye. Slight hints of pepper and even fainter hints of lemon. Medium bodied, ample carbonation, slightly grainy and chewey. Pretty refreshing. Another decent beer from River Horse, this time with a more assertive and uniquie flavor.",2009-10-06 14:16:13

Thin head, not the appreciable, but nice lacing. Sunny looking beer. 		S - Just slightly phenolic, with some bubble gum aromas and sweet fruits. Pear maybe? Smells like it may be dry on the palate. 		T - On the sweet side. Nice malt and very oily on my tongue, which makes the flavor seem like honey. Very dry finish, which is welcomed, along with a bit of alcohol kick. 		M - Medium bodied.		D - Crisp, dry. Seems pretty average for the style.",2009-10-06 14:16:54

Smell is of grapefruity hops, slight notes of other citrus, piney and floral hops. Some malt presence. Taste follows scent, but bolder, almost Double IPA like profile. Grapefruity hops upfront, nice spicey and piney back end. Medium bodied, a little less smooth and sticky than other full flavored IPAs. Very good IPA, although lacks a little punch to be full forced, but still not mellow enough to be drank in session.",2009-10-06 14:20:46
7.0,44568,700,Loser Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,BuckeyeNation,4.0," ""When you're a winner you're always happy, but if you're happy as a loser you'll always be a loser.""		Mark 'The Bird' Fidrych		Rich Halloween pumpkin orange with Sunkist highlights when sunshine is allowed entry. The sandstone colored crown is both creamy and firm, with hundreds of glassine bubbles on its superior surface. BB-shot sheets of lace are beginning to decorate the glass in fine fashion.		Elysian has never been a brewery to go easy on the hops, which is why I like their beer so much. This APA features a background of lightly toasted malts and a foreground awash in musky-fruity hoppiness. Although Sorachi Ace and Crystal might not have been my first choices, they work very well together.		Just as the hop bill is a sure-fire hit, the grain bill is a miss. Loser has too much Munich malt flavor, which comes across as a nutty, woody earthiness that is common in most marzens. In a pale ale, it only succeeds in partially masking what ought to be the focus... which is hops. Thankfully, there are enough of those to (barely) earn the higher flavor score.		Sorachi Ace was developed in Japan by Sapporo and is a Brewer's Gold and Saaz cross. It's supposed to be lemony... and is a little. I'm also getting orange rind and ripe apricot. The beer's floral spiciness is probably due to Crystal. One simple change (subtract the Munich) would turn Loser into even more of a winner.		The mouthfeel is fine and dandy. It has plenty of heft for the style and the ABV (7.0% on the label) and has just the right amount of zesty bubbles. Resinous hop burps are always welcome.		Elysian is one of the great unheralded breweries of the Pacific Northwest. Most everything they release is outstanding, including Dragonstooth Stout, Night Owl Pumpkin Ale, Jasmine Avatar IPA, The Immortal IPA and The Wise ESB. Ironically enough, the Sup Pop motto is appropriate when describing Loser... ""We're not the best, but we're pretty good"".",2009-10-06 14:24:11
3.2,40897,206,Hook & Ladder Lighter,KÃ¶lsch,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,rfgetz,3.0," Slightly hazy golden orange in color, frothy punch of a white head that leaves quickly and leaves nothing behind. Smells of sweet carmel malts, buttery popcorn and slightly stale water. Taste follows scent with a very sweet punch of carmel followed by a buttery popcorn like taste. Thankfully the ""off"" scent was not present in the taste. Light body, slightly undercarbonated, slightly unwelcomed buttery aftertaste, For a light beer, pretty good. For a beer, pretty average.",2009-10-06 14:26:18
6.3,1493,273,Sweetwater IPA,American IPA,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,apbarwood,4.0, Pale amber color with a small amount of lace and some rimming. Loses a point for head retention but pretty nice overall. Strong aroma with citrus flavors leaping out of the glass and coming through nicely on the palate. Loads of grapefruit and some sweet orange flavors and I almost feel like there's some mango in there as well. It seems a little softer than most IPA's. It's different but nice. Very drinkable and better than I had expected to be honest. A nice choice for an IPA from the Southeast.,2009-10-06 14:28:53
5.0,580,105,Miller High Life,American Adjunct Lager,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,rfgetz,2.5," Used to have a few here or there as a kid when it was on special for $1... this beer usually meant the night was not gonna go to well for my stomach. Kicked it old school at a beer pong tournament and this was the beer of choice (not mine, someone elses)...		Bright golden yellow in color, almost artificial looking hues. Huge plume of frothy head, leaves quickly with no trace. Smell is of light grass, stale water and bland corn. Taste is a relatively ineffensive light grass and corn flavor with just a hint of the before mentioned stale water. Somewhat bitter bite at the end. The body is light, ampley carbonated and very dry finnish. Drinkability is low because it always seems to do something to my stomach that i wont review here.",2009-10-06 14:33:53
4.9,21300,35,Samuel Adams Black Lager,Schwarzbier,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,Anthony1,3.5," Pours dark brown in color, but not dense looking, with about two fingers of tan head. Settles to a thin but full lace, leaves some stick. 		Smell has a soft roasted aroma along with some sweet caramel, even a hint of chocolate. It's light and clean with a distinct lager aroma to it. Taste also has some roasted malt and some sweeter elements of caramel and chocolate. There's a grainy, bready quality to it, and a bit of bitterness in the finish to balance it out. Clean and smooth. My only complaint is that the flavors are a bit too thin, although the flavor overall is good.",2009-10-06 14:35:21

On draft as a comparison to my earlier review of it from a bottle...		Notable differences include:	- less dominant pumpkin pie spicing with a more prominant semi-sweet pumpkin pie filling taste	- body is slightly smoother and creamier		On draft definitely prefered over bottle, but the best pumpkin beer available today regardless of the serving format.",2009-10-06 14:39:31
4.7,53108,853,Black Oak Oaktoberfest,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,bobsy,4.0," I had this at the C'est What Fall Festival, and it was so good I had to go back for more. This is the new seasonal from Ken and Adrian, and will be available on draft and bottled at the brewery store.		Pours a brownish amber with a large creamy white head, that leaves huge drapes of lacing as it recedes to a thick and uneven collar. Toasted malt aroma, with splashes of smoke, caramel, biscuit and floral hopping.There are even some light coffee and cocoa notes lingering in the background. Malt heavy flavour begins toasted, transitions to sweet and ends smoky. Light floral hopping provides a lightly bitter finish. They've nailed the mouthfeel, which is richly textured, creamy and sessionable. What carbonation there is helps to bulk the body up to medium.		Hooray for cask oktoberfests! I'm looking forward to the bottle release of this to see how it compares.		Edit: I had it on regular tap a few weeks later, and I don't think the beer loses anything. The texture is quite different with an obviously higher carbonation, but its still full and smooth. Other than that everything else seems more or less identical to the cask version.",2009-10-06 14:40:49
4.5,4582,1170,Wheat Ale,Witbier,3.0,2.5,4.0,2.0,khiasmus,3.0," Milky, yellow, a plop of creamy head atop, approx-a-finger. Pretty lacing about the glass, a white sheet, but the cloudiness is too much, looks like a health drink from a health-food shoppe or a home based business... like yellow milk. 	As for the whiffs... lemon-grass and pear, honeysuckle, none of the normal banana or clove. 	The flavour offers more lemon-grassy-fields, windy, sunny, bright, and spices blowing through the wind... Nutmeg? Coriander? Ginger. it's Ginger. Ginger, that's it, that's the finish-flavour. The initial taste is lemony and bright, then it descends to a massive amount of spice, and that's it.	Flattish-milky, smooth, none of the light carbonation that this style needs. This one drinks like a lightly carbonated glass of milk in the mouthfeel.	This one was okay, but too much for the spicing. It's a spicy, milky mess, really. It's somehow strangely drinkable, but seems to be more of a specialty/spice beer rather than a typical wheat ale, and the yellow-milk look and mouthfeel really ruin it for me.",2009-10-06 14:41:24

Pours caramel amber with a head that lasts awhile beofre becoming a patch. Thin lines of lacing stick.		The smell is of hops galore! Very pleasant, too! Pine with citric/tropical fruits - grapefruit, pineapple, mango, etc. With caramel, slight bread and hint of peppery spice.		The taste is of tropical/citrus fruits - nicely hopped with a caramel kiss balancing it out in the finish.		The body is medium to full and exceptionally creamy and smooth.

Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Seidel.		Shows a clear, ruby-copper hue, capped by a half-inch off-white/light tan head of creamy foam. Head retention is decent, but stickage is a little lax.		Nose is full of malty goodness, sweet and toasty with just a tad of maple drizzled over the top. Some grassy hop notes are interspersed. Very pleasing and inviting.		A wonderful medium-full body drapes the tongue, rich and chewy, perfectly accentuating the toffeed, toasted malt palate. Sweetbread, biscuit, toffee, some faint caramel and brown sugar; hops show themselves in the middle to keep things balanced by leave the malt to take center stage, with a finish that is mildly dry and clean with some lingering malt sweetness on the back of the tongue. Alcohol shows itself not on the palate, but is apparent afterward in the head.		A wonderful, bold example of the style, the likes of which is not seen often in the gaggle of seasonal Oktoberfest/Mrzen beers released for the fall. Certainly a nice end to the celebration and a top-notch example befitting those strong, malty brews originally brewed in the spring for lagering until Fall. Highly recommended.",2009-10-06 14:44:50
8.5,36333,423,Saison - Brett,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,bonbright7,5.0," As the cage was released, the cork hit the ceiling like a bullet, I knew this bottle was going to be entertaining. The volume of carbonation was immense as if we had been reviewing a great champagne and I thought wide brimmed champagne style glasses or flutes would have been proper for this remarkable ale. 		The orange gold haze of the ale looked fine was it settled down after exhausting its millions of little bubbles to announce its debut. My first sense of the aroma was noted with spices and oranges as I met the first taste. It was amazing in its menu of flavors as the citrusy and spicy ale wasn't sour in the least to me.		Caught in the magic of the moment by this great ale, I noted the allure was highlighted by the ale not being sour, though a combination of tart and sweetness did prevail. Overall, a great bottle as a peer to the best in its style.",2009-10-06 14:46:20

6.5,13896,73,Great Lakes Oktoberfest,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,nickynick,4.0," Great Lakes Oktoberfest poured a nice amber color, however lost some points because it lacked head and lacing. Smell was nice of bready malts and hops. Taste showed nice balance between the bready and slightly sweet malt, with a nice hop finish, enough there to notice, but did not over take the malt. The malt stood out. Mouthfeel was good for the style. Drinkability was good, almost to good for a beer with this ABV. Overall I thought this was a nice version of the style. I feel to often American made Ofests or often overly sweet. This one had that nice sweet malt, but not overly sweet, and all in balance.",2009-10-06 14:48:16

6.0,2358,769,Amsterdam Oktoberfest Lager,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,2.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,bobsy,3.5," This is the 2009 version, brewed as a marzen-rauchbier and aged for six and a half weeks.		Pours a rich chestnut colour, with a short lived tan head that exhibits the brewery's continuing problems with retention. Sweet, smoky aroma (like charred wood), with a toasty base and a hint of spice. Flavour seems a little too simple for my liking, as well as too sweet. It starts off with smoke, moves on to sweet bready malts, before moving on to brown sugar and a spicy woodiness in the finish. Smoke lingers on the palate a while longer. Body is good for the style - medium feel with a decent carbonation.		I do like this beer, although I think the residual sugars are too high for it to be sessionable for me, and I prefer the other local oktoberfests over this. Well worth a try though, and an interesting take on the style.",2009-10-06 14:51:48

Pours clear yellow with a light meaty smoke aroma. Light smoke flavor too. A mild, refreshing lager with a one-dimensional smoke flavor. Balanced and light, worlds apart from the Bamberg smoke bombs.

Taste is similar, big vanilla and biscuit, grainy middle, caramel, toast, clean malt character with a nice balanced finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very drinkable stuff.

Pours a slightly opaque dark reddish brown, almost black, thick tan head forms, settles down to a thin ring and leaves some lace chunks on the glass. Smell is alright, roasty and chocolate, toast, dark fruit, caramel, quite sweet, not a whole lot of maple character going on though. Taste is similar, no real maple at all, sweet, brown sugar and caramel, some roast, bit sweet and sour through the middle, a bit biscuit, nice roast, but not much else. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Half decent but wheres the maple? And not much of a porter at that.",2009-10-06 14:58:35

Brown bread aroma, with nuts and a light chocolate sweetness. Straightforward flavour, but well done - again brown bread, some caramel and ghosts of chocolate, berries and coffee. Not overly complex, but emminently sessionable. Body is as it should be for a cask, and helps punch this beer up a little.		Charles MacLean's beers are under-rated. he does the English style very well, and that's hard for a lot of North Americans to understand.",2009-10-06 14:59:02

Suspended particles (hop flakes?) giving it a thick, syrupy appearance. Nice white head dissipates into a just-ok lacing.	Nice malty-sweet aroma with the hops kicking around. Somewhat subdued, for the style.	Grapefruit, pine make up the bulk of the flavor. A bucket-load of hops in every sip, leaving the expected dry bitter finish.	Bitter, bitter, bitter. What else did you expect?	Yet another DIPA on the market; gives you the hop-fix you crave. Not particularly balanced, but should it be?	This is often compared to its competitor Bell's and their Hopslam, but there's no comparison in my opinion. Still, a good take on the style and worth the price of admission.",2009-10-06 15:06:35

The smell is fruity - banana, pear, with spicy bread and pepper.		Te taste is fruity - banana, pear with a sweet and spicy character with a drying hop touch in the finish.		It has a creamy, crisp light-to-medium body. Coating. Alcohol very well-covered for abv.		A unique, fruity interpretation. Very refreshing for a high abv brew!",2009-10-06 15:08:54
9.8,185,141,Smuttynose Imperial Stout (Big Beer Series),Russian Imperial Stout,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,BetterDarker,4.0," Decided to give the whole RIS wave a ride, a bit behind, but the price was right and better late than never.		Bomber poured into snifter.		A- Well, black, as one would expect. Beautiful mocha head, a good inch that lasted through out the drink.		S- Roasted malt, minor noble hop aroma, smells great!		T- Wow, what a tasty beer, I wasn't sure what to expect since I'm not familiar with the style, and I loved every sip. Full roast flavor, mild bitterness and a smooth after taste.		M- Surprisingly medium bodied, not syrupy, quite smooth and well carbonated.		D- Very drinkable, almost too drinkable considering the ABV.",2009-10-06 15:09:28
7.5,31229,804,La Divine Blond,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,4.0,3.5,1.5,3.0,ckeegan04,2.5," A - Lightly hazed bright golden yellow. Thin white foamy cap quickly fades to just a ring around the glass. Very active bubbles quickly rising to the top.		S - Lots of spice up front with cracked white pepper especially noticeable. A light yeastiness underneath and then as the beer warms a somewhat off musty aroma comes through.		T - Strong yeasty taste up front but very unpleasnt. Becomes more stringent very quickly. Light spiciness of clove and pepper with underlying fruit tastes. Finishes with a weird tart/sour mix with a touch of mustiness. Just an all around weird (and poor) mix of flavors.		M/D - Light and crisp. The right feel for a Belgian pale, just not a great taste. It is very rare that I drain pour, but this is one of those times.",2009-10-06 15:11:09
4.8,43590,423,Pilsner,German Pilsener,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,BradLikesBrew,4.0," Thanks to John for bringing this bottle back from KC.		Creamy white head, clear golden body. Bright toasty malt aroma with notes of floral hops. The flavor is classic pils; lightly toasted malt with a floral, grassy hop flavor. Bitterness is low, but sufficient for balance. Mouthfeel is spot on. I could drink a gallon. Thanks John!",2009-10-06 15:15:40
5.3,103,35,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,American Pale Wheat Ale,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,Anthony1,4.0," Pours a somewhat hazy medium gold color with an ample amount of white head. Retention is poor for a wheat beer and there is some lacing left after the initial pour fades to a nice sheen.		Nose is filled with lemon zest, those pesky, peppery grains of paradise, snappy wheat and mangoes. Taste is light and spicy, with the grains o' paradise and wheat flavors leading the way. The flavor feels a bit 'softer' out of the bottle than it does on tap.",2009-10-06 15:18:17
7.3,2184,718,Petrus Aged Pale,Flanders Oud Bruin,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,jminsc76,3.5," Into a Delirium tulip, pours a nice white head atop a murky, orange-ish body. Exhibits some decent lacing at first but dissolves quickly. The head reemerges greatly upon agitation. 		Refreshing aromas that include slight citrus and grapefruit, horse blankets, and oak. There is some sweetness in the nose as well, perhaps even some vanilla or light butterscotch. A complex bouquet. 		Flavors are tart, funky, earthy, and slightly fruity. Produces a puckering reaction, and while it's fairly pleasant, the nose is more complex than the flavor. 		Mouthfeel is a bit dry, almost too much so. Kind of chalky. Then again, I did eat a whole spinach salad prior to this and am wondering if that's contributing to the chalky feeling. Slightly sticky on the gums but also quite light in consistency. 		Overall I give it a good grade. I will have to try this again solo, without the influence of spinach on my palate, but I can imagine the flavors and consistency improving. I will give this one an update.",2009-10-06 15:20:05
5.0,576,113,Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale,English Brown Ale,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,BradLikesBrew,4.0," caramel colored body serves as an apt preview of things to come. Sweet, complex caramel aroma with a nice nuttiness. Sweet caramel maltiness provides the base with nutty malt notes, earthy floral hops, toffee, and brown sugar. Smooth and refreshing, the kind of beer that requires restraint to keep you from chugging it. Subtle, mild, and utterly English.",2009-10-06 15:21:50
10.0,40968,22,Unibroue 17,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,BradLikesBrew,4.0," Muddy brown body, expansive and frothy tan head. Sheet of lace. Sweet, brandy-like boozy aroma with notes lavender. Sweet brown sugar upfront with notes of candied fruit. I am either too overwhelmed, or too lazy to list all of the flavors I am experiencing here...let's just call it complex. Boozy and full-bodied. Reminds me of an English Barleywine with Belgian yeast. The Unibroue Anniversary ales hit the mark every time. Recommended.",2009-10-06 15:27:48
9.5,42723,158,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,American Double / Imperial Stout,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,bobsy,4.0," This had been on my wants for a while, so a big thanks to ritzkiss for pulling it out of his endless stash of coffee flavoured stouts.		Pours a pitch black with a thick mocha head. The retention is excellent and it leaves behind sheets of lace. A first class appearance worthy of an emperor. The aroma goes heavy on the espresso, but also marries it perfectly to chocolate, dark fruit and grapefruit. This perfect marriage is also found in the flavour - a shot or two of espresso, bittersweet chocolate and light citrus in the finish. Its rich, thick and heavy in flavour. Surprisingly I don't find much of the vanilla that I do in the regular oaked version. Body and carbonation are medium.		I liked this a lot, though I'd probably stick to the regular oak aged in the future.",2009-10-06 15:30:21
4.1,51464,29,Bud Light Golden Wheat,Herbed / Spiced Beer,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,cgstarry,4.0," This is a very good light beer. Especially for fans of wheat beers who are planning to be standing at the end of the night or are watching their caloric intake. 		A - Very good. Just what it should be. Hazy copper with a 3/4"" head that fades to a nice skim and leaves some lace as you go. 		S - Fresh and citrus. Light and refreshing. 		T - Light, but very good for what it is intended to be. A light beer with some flavor and character. 		M - Smooth and pleasant. Carbonation is just right. 		D - Awesome. Had six of these last night over the course of three hours while watching Favre and the Vikings pound the Packers. Got up at the end of the game and felt great. The residual yeast in the bottle also helps your body metabolize the alcohol out of your system so woke up feeling great as well. 		Overall this is a very nice light beer. I will definitely have some around for the times when I want a decent beer but don't want to be too aggressive with the booze.",2009-10-06 15:30:30

5.3,108,35,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,Anthony1,2.5," Pours a hazy, lazy yellow with a small bubbly head, no retention and minimal lacing, barely even a crown on the glass. 		Nose is sweet, bright cherries. The label says this is brewed with cherries and cherry flavor added, so some of the nose may be artificial. 	Taste is smooth and easy, pleasant cherry taste and not anywhere near as sweet as it smells. Decent malt balance, a touch of yeast, and slightly more than average carbonation make this a genuine entry for a fruit flavored beer instead of just dumping in some fruit juice at the end and calling it so. A good beer to have with dessert and a fine session brew for the fall or spring.",2009-10-06 15:35:37

Nose is bitterweet chocolate and roasted malt, but not very strong. Initial sip reveals a creamy and rich mouthfeel with just a hint of hops background. Taste echos the nose, and burnt coffee taste comes in at about mid glass. Seems a bit watered down for a stout. Finish is dry and somewhat bitter.",2009-10-06 15:38:41

5.45,2684,35,Samuel Adams Honey Porter,English Porter,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,Anthony1,3.0," Pours out to a clear, filtered dark brown, nearing black, forming a creamy light tan head with yellow accents. Retention is good, and lacing is average. Carbonation is moderate. The aroma is very English as one could guess from the ingredients...there is that ruddy soapy cardboardy nose I get from alot of English Ales, and I'm not particularly fond of, as well as honey when swirled and some buttery diacetyl (Wormwood?). Carbonation is fine and contributes to a smoother than anticipated mouthfeel, with a medium-dense body. The taste begins with wet cardboard, diacetyl, followed by a touch of honey sweetness and roasted grains in the middle",2009-10-06 15:40:03

The smell featured a solid yeast element with undertones of coriander. The taste was spicy and wheaty with a definite yeast and coriander and clove flavor. The mouthfeel was full and mildly chewy.

Thick, two finger creamy brown cap slowly fades to a 1/4 inch head. Excellent looking stout.		S - Roasted malts with hints of chocoalte. Nice aromas coming from this one, but they are all a touch muted. As the beer warms a light citrusy hoppiness comes through. The roasted aromas dominate throughout though.		T - Light chocolate, roasted grains, a touch of coffee and a surprisingly strong citrus taste. The flavors are very ell mixed and come and go surprisingly quick throughout the drink. A very enjoyable mix. One of the strongest citrus hop profiles I have ever experienced in a stout.		M/D - Medium bodied with a stronger creaminess towards the end.

The smell is of malt, tons of malt with hops being slightly detectable. Caramel scent along with dried fruit. The taste of this beer is overwhelming in the best way possible.

A: The beer is a light brown color, with a short off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.		S: The aroma is of tea, citrus, caramelized malts and a touch of hops.		T: The taste starts out with semi-sweet flavors of tea, caramel, spices and some citrus. Then there's a bitter bite that doesn't seem to come from the mild hops presence and there doesn't seem to have the best balance either. The after-taste is slightly bitter.		M: Crisp but not very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean.		D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely several other organic beers that I would pick before this one.",2009-10-06 16:12:19

A foamy beige head held great retention and left some sticky lace on the glass. As it dissipated, it left a thin layer of foam atop the ale. Aromas were of baker's chocolate and brown sugar.

This beer is definitely a bastardized example of a wheat lies under the American wheat category in my opinion. Aroma has slight lemony tones with hints of a metallic offness to it, no special fireworks missing some serious yeast characteristics. The taste is a slight buttery sweetness with some contrasting hop bitterness apparent in the flavor profile. Slight mild banana tones with a nice smoot finish one refreshing beer. Mouthfeel is a light to medium bodied",2009-10-06 16:27:37

Over three-fingers of fluffy foam sits on top. It recedes to a thin surface covering after a couple of minutes. Lacing is lace-like and quite sticky.		Very good belgian yeast presence. Nice notes of bananas and a touch of lemons. Slight hint of oranges. Good spice presence. Mild grassiness.		Taste follows the nose quite well. Nicely yeasty with good fruit sweetness and a decent amount of pepperey spiciness. It has a dry finish that seems very nice until the grassy hop bite kicks in and leaves me with an unpleasant (IMO) bitter aftertaste.		Solid medium bodied brew. Slightly high level of carbonation. Clean and smooth, mostly crisp, but a slight touch of creaminess does come through.		This is a very drinkable beer, in general. A strong representation of the style.

Pours a clear amber, medium sized white head forms, settles to a medium sized ring around the glass rather quickly, few lace spots stick around. Smell is nice, floral, clovers, honey, caramel, a bit sugary, grapefruit, tangerine, some oranges, a bit herbal and fruity. Taste is similar, sweet and malty but the base is pretty weak, grapefruit and some floral, fruit, decent hoppiness but needs more malt and more bitterness. Mouthfeel is meidum bodied with low to medium carbonation. Doesn't feel as thin in the body as most Trafalgar, but the malt could use some work. All in all pretty decent considering who made it.",2009-10-06 16:30:38

Head retention is amazing and tight as can be.		Rich chocolate, banana, light coffee and hops.		Deep complexity. Lots of chocolate and coffee. Rich and delicious. Reminiscent of a mocha milkshake. Noticeable hop presence is nice. Dark raisiny fruit. Sweet toasted malt is not burnt tasting which is a plus. Coffee is noticed most at the end. Alcohol rears its head a moderate amount as well.		Full bodied, slick and smooth oil like feel. Enough soft carbonation to keep the flavors rolling. Good amount of heat from the booze. Dry and clean finish.		Not as much of a sipper as one would think. Well hidden alcohol. Hard to set this down. One of the best examples of the style.",2009-10-06 16:32:25
6.0,53127,1114,Hop Harvest 2009,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,Kegatron,4.5," On tap @ the brewpub on 10/2/09. Served in a pint glass. 		Pours a clear copper, with a thin wispy head of brite-white foam. This stays relatively rich around the edges, leaving back some creamy looking swathes of lacing. The aroma is straight up HOLY CITRUS! This is just dripping with fruit flavors, along with floral and herbal hop accents. Some caramel and bread add extra sweetness to the nose, but this really is all about the citrus notes. 		The taste starts with a moderately aggressive spicy and piney hop bite, before being evened out by that same ridiculous amount of tropical citrus, and to a lesser extent, toasted bread. Really nice balance here between the bitterness and tanginess in the mouth. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a crisp prickle to the carbonation. Hop oils make for a much slicker foundation underneath, keep this moving easily for the size of it. 		Wow, the Simcoe and Chinook hops really did wonders here, turning a normal ESB into a fresh American Hop-Bomb of epic proportions! This is seriously probably the best hoppy creation that I've had from these guys yet. Well done!",2009-10-06 16:32:52

The porter appears a translucent chestnut color with about an inch of creamy ecru foam. Flavors and aromas are of milk chocolate, mocha, caramel, toasted sweet bread, medium roasted grains, a hint of char and coffee. Maybe a notch better than medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Certainly worth trying and quite reasonably priced as well.",2009-10-06 16:33:37
9.5,50697,2210,Double Jack,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.5,5.0,4.0,4.0,Telix,4.5," On-draft at the Toronado, served in a tulip glass.		A: A nice, tight head floats atop a ludicrously clear deep, DEEP copper liquid - the kind of beer that looks appetizing in the glass.		S: I got a slightly toasted caramel sweetness with some floral hops, some warm spice and citrus bitterness underneath a strong cinnamon-apple note - amazing and inviting.		T: WOW - apples apples apples, cinnamon apples, but sweet and light. Awesome, totally unexpected, and damn good. A bit cidery, with some maple syrup but decidedly NOT syrupy. Fresh, clean, and tasty.		M: Very nice. Creamy, smooth, mildly thick but not syrupy. It works well to support the flavors.		D: Not super sessionable, but so flavorful and awesome you want more.		I'm extremely glad I was able to have this while in SF. Highly recommended, but if you are looking for a DIPA you may be disappointed. Unique and amazing.",2009-10-06 16:34:14

A: The beer is a light gold color, with a thin white head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.		S: The aroma is of lager yeast, hops and light malts.		T: The taste is very bready with flavors of grain, lager yeast and a light but hearty malt character. The hops presence is decent for the style. I was also getting a flavor of corn in there that makes it taste too similar to a macro for my liking. The after-taste is slightly bready.		M: Crisp and a little smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean.		D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not the first beer I would pick in the style but it's a good lighter beer for the pub to offer to the masses in lieu of a macro.",2009-10-06 16:37:52

6.1,22790,863,Blind Pig IPA,American IPA,3.5,5.0,4.0,3.5,Telix,3.5," I had this on draft at the Toronado in a pint glass. I'm clearly going to be below the average rating on this review, but I'll admit that is mostly due to the fact that I'm not a tremendous lover of West Coast IPAs.		L: A clear golden orange with minimal head, and apparently low carbonation in general. It looks fine, for sure, but nothing really amazing at all.		A: The nose is where this beer shines, in my opinion. Fresh fresh fresh, with bitter zippy hops supported by a backbone of sweetness. Pine needles in clover honey.		T: The slightest malt backbone is overrun by bitter American hops, and finishes with a tiny bit of sweetness. The tiny finish leaves the tongue feeling clean, and the intense citrus and grapefruit flavors make the beer quite refreshing. It's a bit too bitter and dry for my palate, however.		M: Thinnish but perfectly adequate. It's not a syrupy IPA - but it's the west coast, it's to be expected. A nice carbonation level makes it not thin enough to be bad, but I'd prefer a bit more body.		D: High - perhaps too high. It has a great quenching ability - almost a session beer but the high bitterness would wear you out quickly.		I think I prefer Blind Pig to Pliny, actually, but both are still a bit on the dry/bitter end for me. It's clearly well-made and worth having at least a few times in your life.",2009-10-06 16:49:14

Pours a cloudy hazy, with little to no head, could have been the cask though. very hazy orange hue.		Smells of straight spice.

14.5,10672,1549,Bourbon County Brand Stout,American Double / Imperial Stout,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,orenand33,5.0," This is my first beer review simply because I haven't made it a priority to review even though beer is a huge part of my life. I had to write about this amazing beer.		This is one of the best beers that I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. This 2008 poured out a deep dark color with a very thin head due to the 13% alcohol that was surprisingly drinkable. The flavor was robust with that of dark chocolate, vanilla, toffee and dark berries like cherry and plum . . . very malty and sweet. This beer is overwhelming in every sense. Simply amazing.		I had this my last night of visiting my family outside of Wichita, Kansas and have not found it nearby in Austin, Texas. I am going to have to have them ship me some for special occasions.",2009-10-06 16:53:34
8.6,38394,3818,Pumking,Pumpkin Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Anthony1,4.0," A one finger head right after the pour, that recedes to a small island of foam andring. Good medium copper hue with a very strong column of bubbling. The aroma is hearty pumpkin bread, strong malt notes and a well integrated pumpkin aroma. The taste is equally bready and pumpkin-ey, but with more emphasis on spices. Notes of numeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar come throuh in the middle. The finish is a dry, grainy pumpkin bread. Good sipping beer on a brisk october evening.",2009-10-06 16:54:54

Appears a hazed golden yellow color with about an inch of fluffy off white foam. No lacing to speak of. Aromas and flavors consist of apricots, peach, caramel, lemon, wheat, apples, bananas, quite the fruit bowl here. A tad better than medium bodied with ample carbonation. Nice looking label as well.",2009-10-06 16:55:09
8.0,51102,863,Publication,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,Telix,3.0," Served in a tulip glass at the Toronado.		A: A nice pillowy head sits atop a copper body and slowly fades over time. The brew itself isn't cloudy but is a bit opaque.		S: A bit of banana, pepper, mustard greens and butter. Very mild, but there. Not exactly up-front or overly appetizing.		T: A surprisingly creamy, mild and soft flavor profile. It's subtly effervescent with a slight banana note. The slightly lemony sourness balances the creaminess. It's honestly surprisingly boring - there isn't anywhere near the depth of flavor as in the truly excellent saisons. It's pretty good, sure, but pretty good isn't exactly anything special.		M: It's creamy and smooth and supports the flavors, but it's not mind blowing. It's fine, that's about it.		D: It has a good drinkability - it's tasty and light, which makes it easy drinking. However, the lack of interesting flavors doesn't make you want to go back for many more.		I was pretty disappointed in this, and don't recommend it very highly.",2009-10-06 16:56:59

A: The beer is a deep coppery brown color, with a thin off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.		S: The aroma is of caramelized malts, fruit, spices, lager yeast and a touch of hops.		T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of caramel, spices and fruit that are followed by a breadiness from a hearty malt character and lager yeast. The hops presence is decent for the style. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly bready.		M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.		D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for the style.",2009-10-06 17:00:16
6.5,40813,16790,Bravoure,Smoked Beer,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,johnmichaelsen,3.5," A Belgian smoked beer? Really? First one I've ever seen, and I must say this is the least ""smokey"" smoked beer I've ever come across. Interestingly, there was nothing on the label to indicate that this is smoked beer. Oh well.		The beer pours a peachy red color with very good head retention and lacing. On the nose I get a cosiderable amount of spice, which includes lemon, quinine and juniper.... maybe some underlying butter and rootbeer as well. The nose is really pretty intriguing. Flavors on the palate generally replicate the nose, though they're not nearly as intense as what I got on the nose. This beer is surprisingly smooth on the palate, but with some nice light sweetness as well. The beer is slighty sweet, but the finish is on the dry side. Alcohol is well disguised in this beer and drinkability is very high. 		A very interesting beer; one quite unlike anything I've had in some time. For such a relatively low alcohol beer, I thought there was a lot going on in it. Enjoyable.",2009-10-06 17:01:49
6.2,44798,1114,Busted Lawnmower,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,Kegatron,4.0," On tap @ the brewpub on 10/2/09. Served in a tulip glass. 		Pours a deep hazy orange, with a 1/2 finger of brite-white creamy head. Rich bunching around the edges, leads to a quality flareup and a nice looking foamy cascade of lacing. The aroma is very bright smelling in the nose. Softer citric notes of apricot and peach, peppery spice, bready sweetness, a good bit of earthy and musty yeast. The Brett adds a refreshing tart edge to the other flavors, keeping this fresh and vibrant in the nose. 		The taste is silky in the mouth, and once again, very fresh and vivid. Citrus, sweet bread, and the dry spiciness of the yeast, take a back seat to the Brett, which actually comes off as fairly well restrained. It adds a biting tartness and overall refreshing quality to the flavor profile, while also bringing an extra amount of strong dryness to the Saision character. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but the feel is so velvety and silky in the mouth, it feels like less. There is an effervescent prickle to the carbonation but it just fleshes out the thirst quenching nature of this. 		About as a pleasant of an easy drinking Saison that I've had in a while, this ""extra Bretted"" version really brought the goods. Just so fresh and lively on tap, I could have passed my time in the brewpub just sipping on this all day.",2009-10-06 17:08:10
10.5,41453,16055,Hr. Frederiksen,Russian Imperial Stout,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,johnmichaelsen,4.0," The beer pours a blackish brown color with very good head retention and lacing. On the nose, I get the protypical IS aroma of coffee, vanilla and chocolate, along with some underlying booziness and coffee grounds. While nothing earth shattering, the nose is certainly attractive. Flavors on the palate generally replicate the nose, except the vanilla seems to be much more pronounced. There is also some nice bitterness on the finish, which counters very nicely the moderate sweetness. The mouthfeel is interesting, with almost a milky quality on the palate. Otherwise, this beer has a pretty full bodied mouthfeel, with the alcohol pretty well hidden for such a high abv. You can tell this is a big beer of course, but the alcohol isn't heavy or tiring on the palate.		While nothing extraordinairy, this is a solid enough beer. Not bad at all.",2009-10-06 17:08:47

The ale appears a hazed amber brown color with about an inch of creamy light ecru foam. Nice head retention with minimal lacing. Nose and flavors are of caramel, raisins, plums, brown sugar, molasses, sweet bread, yeast, ripe pears, dates, bananas. Approaching full bodied with ample carbonation.

Generous foam off the pour, the fluffy tan cap settled slowly, leaving behind a few clumpy chunks of lace. Sweet, malty aroma with some roast, faint cherry. Same in the flavour. Mild bitterness even from the dark malts. Notes of chocolate and caramel filled out the flavour. Lingering sweetness. Medium bodied with average carbonation, decent texture. A nice, drinkable beer.",2009-10-06 17:14:52
7.0,1093,287,Two Hearted Ale,American IPA,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,blackearth,4.5," Pours a light amber body with a big, fluffy white head. Aroma is dominated by citrus and slightly piney hops scents. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Great hop presence that is on the higher side of medium intensity. Just the right amount for an American Pale. Hop flavors come through from start to finish, but the malt backbone is present. Overall great drinkability.",2009-10-06 17:17:23
8.0,30968,2958,La Madragore,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,4.0,4.5,3.5,3.5,atis,3.5," Pours black with foamy brown head that fades to dense layer, patchy lacing. Aroma is funky sour malt, dried cherries and dried fruit in general, one of the best smelling beers I have ever had.		Taste is fruity, kind of ripe fruit type, slightly sour and alcoholic bitterness, becoming astringent towards the rather dry finish. Mouthfeel is very light with prickly and slightly above moderate carbonation and noticeable alcohol warming.		Overall, the aroma was fantastic, the taste not so, it also felt too light.",2009-10-06 17:18:11

Hazy golden color with a small white head that leaves just a little foam, and good lacing. Great aroma, tart with funk, honey, lemon, oak, and floral hops. Flavor is barnyard funk, honey, floral hops, spices, dry white wine, oak, and lemony bretty tartness. Very tasty and complex. Nice smooth palate, only slightly acidic. Drinkability high. Overall this is a great sour ale.",2009-10-06 17:19:48
7.4,45770,13307,Not Just Another Wit,Witbier,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,mikesgroove,4.0," Another wrapped and caged gem from mikellar that I had the privilege of being able to try. This one I brought over as I thought it might go quite well with dinner. Served cold and poured into a few tasting glasses along the way, this one was consumed on 10/05/2009. 	 	The pour was just as I would have wanted. Light golden amber in color with a nice foamy head of white on top. Rich lacing that just drips down the side of the glass and really coating the entire interior making it almost totally clouded over. Aroma is light, bready malts, hints of light citrus and a touch of spice coming through on the nose right away. Nice balance here as it is no where near to heavy. Light fruit notes now coming forward, peaches maybe, a touch of some light grain as well. Nice clean flavor, does not last long on the tongue, nor is it too terribly heavy. I would have to say it comes off just about right. Nice dry finish with a quick hit of hops and a light tart grape skin like flavor that melts back as quick as it started. 	 	Overall pretty darn solid. Not really sure what to make of the style, but I have to admit it was pretty good. Would not mind trying this one again any day.",2009-10-06 17:21:17
9.5,50176,158,Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti,American Double / Imperial Stout,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,chrhal1006,4.0," We purchased this bottle from Total Wine in Delaware over the weekend. We popped the top on it last night and the pour was very nice. Very dark with a nice thick foamy head that you would expect from a Stout. Not as thick as Guiness and settled rather quickly. The smell was really mild and we could not pick up much of anything except some charred wood. 		The initial tast was very smooth. Could pick up sutle hints of chocolate, and a lot of that charred wood. It went down really smooth and was very easy to drink. 		Want was neat was that as we got to the bottom the hints of chocolate became a lot more pronounced and the flavors really started to kick in.",2009-10-06 17:21:27

Aromas of sour cherries, dark fruits, apple cider vinegar. Taste is very sour and tart with more dark fruit and cherries. There is also vanilla, oak, and balsamic vinegar along with funky barnyard. Overall this is a good Oud Bruin, but I prefer my sour beers to have less of the vinegar acetic acid character.",2009-10-06 17:22:44

Bottle shared by largadeer on BA in a quest for the worst beer ever tasting. Wow, Eel River, WTF? Is this really a beer? This is basically the acai berry version of what I'd expect Bud Select 55 to taste like. Pours a clear, watery golden-yellow with a small white head. Aroma is very light with butter and light fruit juice. Flavor is mild acai berry, seltzer water, just a touch of wheat, and butter. Palate is almost exactly like Fruit2O or some other carbonated fruit water. Hey, at least it's drinkable. Good way to hydrate.",2009-10-06 17:22:53
,52832,619,Spicy Pumpkin Ale,Pumpkin Ale,2.5,2.0,1.0,2.0,nickd717,1.0," Ok, I was the first to review this, then my review got deleted. largadeer was kind enough to share another bottle with me, which was worse than the first, so I'm lowering my rating from a D+ to a D-. Terrible cooked vegetable note on the aroma and flavor this time. This is awful.		Earlier review from ratebeer (luckily I review on both):	First to review! Single 12oz bottle purchased for $1.50 at Whole Foods in Los Altos. Pours clear golden orange with a fizzy white head. Aroma is pumpkin spice and pale malt. Seems really heavily spiced. Flavor is fairly sweet pale malt and loads of pumpkin spice - too much nutmeg and cinnamon - as well as some tree bark, with a dry, empty finish. Palate watery and thin with some zing from the spices. This beer is the antithesis of balance. The spice level is way too high. Not very drinkable.",2009-10-06 17:26:11
7.0,6260,10099,Punkin Ale,Pumpkin Ale,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,blackearth,4.5," Purchased at Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a bright, orange-amber body with an off white head that eventually falls completely. Aroma is sticky sweet sugar, like cinnamon buns. Pumpkin is also detectable in the aroma. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with big malt sweetness upfront in the flavor. There's brown sugar and pie spice flavors in there too. There's a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish and a slight alcohol warmth as it goes down. Very good beer for a cool October evening.",2009-10-06 17:26:56
10.5,1160,147,Stone Imperial Russian Stout,Russian Imperial Stout,5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,scottyshades,4.5," My review got deleted, this is off memory		A: Pours a very thick and viscous black color with absolutely no highlights, even when held to light. The head is nice and tight, mocha in color, retains exceptionally well throughout the entire 22oz bomber, and leaves thick sheets of lacing along the glass. Absolutely perfect score.		S: Very robust nose. Roasted/burnt malts are present and up-front, copious amounts of dark fruits (raisins, figs, plums, dates,). Caramel, molasses, coffee/espresso, toffee, and an amazing hop profile that really brings this one to a whole new level. The hops are perfectly balanced and very aromatic. The alcohol is apparent (especially when it warms), but considering the ABV, it is very well hidden.		T: Very similar to the nose. All of the roasted/burnt goodness is present, along with caramel, coffee/espresso, molasses, (didn't get toffee in the flavor), and TONS of dark fruits that seem to blend in pretty well...again, raisins (very noticeable), dates, figs, plums/prunes, and dark cherry. The only difference between the nose and the flavor are the hops. In the flavor, the hops are definitely bitter (also aromatic), and when combined with the malts, this makes one big beer. My only complaint is that the alcohol is a little overwhelming when the beer warms a few degrees.		MF/D: Superior viscosity...one of the thickest I've come across. Very smooth and creamy, long burnt/bitter finish with a touch of alcohol.		For $5.50 a bomber, this is an amazing deal. Also, widely available. Another amazing example from Stone.",2009-10-06 17:27:56

Hope this one sticks:		A bottle of this -bal aged rarity was shared by bring. Thanks, Barry! Pours dark brown with small tan head aroma. Not much lacing to speak of, but looks decent. Aroma is caramel, bourbon, caramel, spice, and vanilla. Smells good. Flavor is very heavy on bourbon, almost to a fault, with caramel, toffee, spices, oak -bal notes, vanilla, and alcohol. Bourbon overwhelms a bit. Palate is fairly smooth and the body is medium, but a little light for style. Drinkability average.",2009-10-06 17:31:42

Aroma is of pumkin pie spices. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Caramelized sugar and cinnamon are too over the top and dominate in the taste. No other flavors get a chance to come through. This is just too one-dimensional and not very good.",2009-10-06 17:33:51

S - Aroma is nail polish, caramel, and some resiny, overboiled hops. Besides the nail polish, it's not too bad.		T - Below average for an IPA, with burnt wood, caramel, resiny hops. A little weird but not too bad. Others were more disgusted by it than I was.		M - Palate a bit watery with medium carbonation.		D - Not so good.",2009-10-06 17:34:57

S - Awesome aroma of whiskey, roast, coffee, chocolate, black cherry, and alcohol.		T - Flavor is very complex and somewhat heavy on the whiskey. Roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate also present, with noticeable alcohol.		M - Palate is medium full, could use a little more body. Soft carbonation.

Limited lace.		S: Grainy husks, hint of corn, adjuncts galore.		T: The beer gives a straight up malt flavour with a hint of corn on the palate, no DMS off flavours. Nice hop attack which was suprising, but very enjoyable and well done, grassy noble hop character.		M: Medium-bodied for the style, little overly fizzy, but a nice feel, clean and crisp.		D: Certainly one of the best adjunct lagers out there. I was certainly suprised by this effort, and would defintely drink it again if I wanted a Euro style lager.",2009-10-06 17:46:54

Quickly receded but left nice spotty lacing.		S: Christmas tree farm pine hops, rich caramel malt. 		T: More of the same from the nose. The piney hops are nice and resinous & oily. Moderately bitter. Good caramel malt base gives the beer a nice warming taste.		M: Oily, resinous. Medium bodied. Clean, healthy bite at the finish. Good carbonation levels activate the flavor but are not distracting.		D: Spot on. Almost ""east coast"" like in balance, but with a profound pine character.",2009-10-06 17:47:01

7.0,31242,9897,BiÃ¨re De Mars - Grand Reserve,BiÃ¨re de Garde,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,johnmichaelsen,4.0," Part of my ""winning bid"" from the last on-line auction with Liquid Solutions.		The beer pours a brownish amber color with good head retention and OK lacing. While the beer doesn't look particularly unusual or special, that thought was quickly dispensed once I breathed in the aroma. The nose on this beer is quite distinct, consisting of vanilla, prunes, sour cherry and light funk. Not sure what the regular JP beire de mars is like, but I'm impressed by how dialed down the funk and sour component is on this version. The added vanilla component really helps IMHO, and I found the nose on this beer quite enticing. Flavors on the palate replicate the nose, though they were a bit more muted then I was expecting. Also, the beer was surprisingly dry, with no more then some light sourness on the finish. Otherwise, the beer has some nice vanilla and citrus to it. Not entirely sure that extended barrel aging has benefited this beer all that much, though it was still quite enjoyable to drink. Mouthfeel is fairly light, but with a long, drawn out finish, and drinkability is exceptional. The alcohol is very well disguised, and with the no more then light sour component, this is probably one of the most drinkable beers I've had from JP. Nice stuff.",2009-10-06 17:55:52
5.6,2652,467,Summit Great Northern Porter,American Porter,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,twiggamortis420,3.0," Pours a dark brown color with some crimson highlighting. Has a dense, creamy tan foam that displays excellent retention and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. Really a great looking beer.		Nose is mostly roasty malt and a little chocolate. Pretty straightforward and simple, but smells nice and fresh. There is a hint of sweetness in there and I do not really get any hops.		Roasty malts are the main show here and even approach coffee-like flavors. There is some bittering hops on the finish that are only helped along by the toasty and roasty components of the malt. There is just a touch of sweetness in here that reminds me a bit of lactose and/or a milk stout. The body is a bit thin and the roast can lean toward astringent, but overall this is a pretty decent little porter here.",2009-10-06 17:57:43
7.0,2751,610,Racer 5 India Pale Ale,American IPA,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,jeffjeff1,4.0," This beer was delicious.

5.1,44531,13014,Hell,Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,blackearth,3.5," Pours a clear golden body with a puffy white head that leaves decent lacing and is slow to fall. Aroma is of light grassy hops and clean malts. Light bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation. A mild bitterness up front leads to a light sweet malt flavor at mid tongue and a slightly bitter finish. Not a bad beer, but I don't find myself wanting a second pint when I'm through with the first.",2009-10-06 18:01:11
5.1,5757,710,Leinenkugel's Oktoberfest,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,4.0,2.5,4.0,3.0,blackearth,3.0," Pours a deep, orange-amber body with a thick, puffy white head. Aroma has some malt sweetness, but also an adjunct smell that reminds me of macro lagers. Corn maybe? Mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonated bite. There are big, sweet toasted malt flavors from start to finish with just a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall, this is a decent beer, but nothing special about it at all.",2009-10-06 18:06:57
7.2,30420,140,Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA,American IPA,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,donniecuffs,4.5," Poured a nice amber/copper color with a thin white head. Decent lacing. If I had my eyes closed, I probably could've told you that this was a Sierra offering, as generous amounts of Cascade-inspired pine and citrus filled my nostrils, with bitter/floral character as well. The flavor hits you with grapefruit and pine, then dissolves mid-palate to bitterness mixed with biscuit and maltiness, and then finishes mildly dry and bitter. Very nicely balanced. The deceiving medium body and decent carbonation hides the alcohol content, and hence makes this a very sessionable ipa...probably TOO sessionable. Well done.",2009-10-06 18:08:25

A- Pours a glowing orange fluid (especially in sunlight) with a small half inch head that falls to barely there froth on top leaving nice spider web lacing.		S- I smell a heavy boozey essence upfront with mild grapefruit and citrus hints. Light malty scents as well.		T-M- Taste is very straight forward... alcohol esters, rich malts and slightly hopped up. I'm not going to lie had to sit back and figure out what i was tasting. In one sentence a alcohol sweet malty beverage with decent hop presence. Mouthfeel is rough and unbalanced with little to no carbonation to get the heavy alcohol flavor over the buds. Thick malty backbone.		D- I could drink this beer at the right price.	I cant remember what it was but well worth it for what it is. Strong and ok flavor.		Note: Drink at 55-60F for the best flavor.",2009-10-06 18:09:07

Very creamy head of light beige colored foam, almost two-fingers worth, sits on top. Retention is excellent and the lacing is almost curtain-like and very sticky.		The nose is somewhat subdued, but still very nice. Mild hints of dark fruits and toasted nuts. Belgian candi sugar and a nice hint of rich maltiness. Good medium yeast presence.		Mmmm....nice medium-level malt presence. Nothing overwhelming, just a nice hint of richness. Hops hit right in the middle. They're not overstated at all, but they kind of overpower the dark fruits that are trying to be noticed. A nice level of spices and a hint of yeastiness comes in at the end.	This beer has a good amount of balance going on. Unfortunately, I want my dubbels to be pretty malt forward, so while this is good, it's not my favorite.		A nice full-bodied brew. Very smooth. Medium level of carbonation, filled with tiny little bubbles. This one has a wonderful amount of creaminess, which is a highpoint for me.		7.0%abv is a little outside of the guidelines for a session beer. As well as it's hidden in this one though, this is a great, drinkable beer",2009-10-06 18:11:17

Nothing interesting at all. Grainy/malty with maybe the slightest hint of hops. Mouthfeel is carbonated and extremely thin. So watery that I couldn't even finish it. It's drinkable in that it doesn't do any offensive or challenging, but it's not enjoyable enough that you'd want to have more than one. Catch 22, I guess.",2009-10-06 18:11:19

Pours a mostly clear light brown, thin off white head forms, and quickly disappears to a thin ring, no real lacing on the glass. Smell is decent, but very light, a bit of caramel, bread, light biscuit and fruit, slightly nutty, not a whole lot going on. Taste is similar, very light, caramel, bread, biscuit, nuts, hint of roasted nuts, decent finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation.

7.8,991,368,Autumnal Fire,Doppelbock,3.5,4.5,5.0,4.0,blackearth,4.5," Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a deep reddish amber body with a thin head that quickly disappears. Aroma is of wood and toffee, reminiscent of a scotch or barleywine. Full bodied with low carbonation. Flavor is a complex woody toasted malt. It gets better with each sip. The alcohol is very well hidden. I would really call this a ""light"" barleywine. Excellent drinkability.",2009-10-06 18:12:34
10.0,52361,287,The Oracle,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.5,5.0,4.0,4.5,johnmichaelsen,4.5," Many thanks to Dyan for sharing this beauty with me the other day. This is a beer I had been hoping to try for some time.		Oracle pours the color of orange medicine, looking just rich and viscuous in the glass. Not surprisingly, head retention and lacing are very, very good. Good as this beer looks (and tastes), the nose is the best thing about this exceptional beer IMHO. Wow! This beer is hugely bitter, imparting sweet oranges, ruby grapefruit, pine and dank earth. The aroma is huge and intense in this beer, and I remember thinking ""now that's what I'm talking about in a DIPA!"" The flavor profile replicates the nose, but is not quite as intense. Still, this is just delicious stuff, with the light, moderate sweetness quickly dominated by a huge wave of hoppy bitterness. The beer also has just a huge presence on the palate, with a very long lasting finish. Alcohol is noticeable (seems as if the abv. has to be up in the 10% range), but is not intrusive or obtrusive in this fine beer.		This is an exceptional DIPA. Thanks Dyan!",2009-10-06 18:12:54
5.6,279,140,Sierra Nevada Porter,American Porter,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,donniecuffs,4.5," I was exceptionally surprised to see that Sierra made a porter that rivaled if not surpassed the quality of its flagship pale ale. From the getgo, the cask pour was a perfect deep brown color, with a thick tan head, that laced perfectly. The smell was malty; not too much individual chocolate or roasted aromas, but it did have a subtle pine/citrus note (possibly from dry-hopping with Cascade?). The flavor was outstanding...roasted malt, subtle cocoa, and a subtle pine finish. Creamy mouthfeel, but not overbearing and quite drinkable, which is very rare for a porter. Again, I was very, very surprised by this result. Well done, Sierra.",2009-10-06 18:16:02
6.8,34968,13302,Snapperhead IPA,American IPA,5.0,4.5,5.0,4.0,oldcrustacean,4.5," Probably the most delicious IPA ever crafted. And in a can! A perfect balance of noble hops and the finest imported malts. This masterpiece of an ale remains true to the Reinheitsgebot -- there is no need to load it up with foreign fruits, teas, arctic snow berries... or whatever else Sam is devising this week. A rare gem. Unpretentious and honest.		I'd drink a bucket of these over Stone or Russian River any day. 		A true gulper.",2009-10-06 18:16:45
5.9,37477,140,Sierra Nevada Anniversary Ale (2007-2009),American IPA,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,Winter,4.0, Pours a dark amber with a rocky off-white head. Malty and hoppy aroma. Nose consists of grapefruit and fresh piney and citrusy Cascade hops. The mouthfeel is soft with a medium body and ample carbonation along the sides of of the tongue. Bright hoppy flavor. Grapefruit and citrus upfront which leads to a bitter piney middle. Juicy hop burps ensue. The finish is smooth for an IPA with a linger Cascade hop piney taste.		This went down really well. Before I knew it half my pint was gone in mere minutes. Very enjoyable IPA.,2009-10-06 18:20:42
13.5,18850,2097,Kuhnhenn Fourth Dementia (4D),Old Ale,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,johnmichaelsen,4.5," Many thanks to Dyan for sharing this beer with me, my first ever beer from Kuhnhenn Brewing.		The beer pours a dark brown color with very good head retention and lacing. The nose on this beer is huge, presenting brown sugar, butter, chocolate and leather. Mama mia, this beer smells great! Flavors on the palate replicate the nose, and I'm impressed by how incredibly rich tasting and intense the flavor profile is. Furthermore, despite considerable sweetness, this beer was not the least bit heavy, cloying or tiring on the palate. I get some slight woodiness on the finish, which only adds to the extremely long and smooth finish. Alcohol is noticeable, but is not intrusive in any way. Still, this is clearly a sipper, and one is all I can ever imagine having of this fine beer. Nevertheless, this is a very flavorful, very big, and very fine beer. Excellent stuff.",2009-10-06 18:20:47

S: Dark, roasted coffee. Bitter dark chocolate. Caramel malts. Booze.		T: A nice earthy, roasted coffee character dominates the profile. Nice underlying chocolate and caramel. The earthy character is the only thing that really hints at the origin of the coffee! Slight booze burn.		M: Thick, chewy. Moderate carbonation. Slightly boozy. Nice lingering finish.		D: Top notch. An interesting brew with an interesting story. Worth a try.",2009-10-06 18:21:23
5.5,25468,568,Palone,Euro Dark Lager,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,Winter,4.0, Pours dark brown; almost a cola-like color in appearance with a rocky light khaki head. The aroma reminds me of a schwartzbier. Sweet malty nose with caramel and toffee. Dark roasted malts. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. Rich malty flavor. You can pick up caramel and raisins midway. The beer finishes with a smokey dark roasted malt quality to it.		I liked this quite a bit. I was expecting a fairly average tasting beer and this was rather enjoyable. Something I'd go back again after having a single of and seek out a six pack to purchase the next time I'm in the mood for something like this. Definitely worth a try.,2009-10-06 18:25:47
10.2,6512,1628,Imperial Russian Stout,Russian Imperial Stout,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,nickd717,4.5," 2008 bottle via trade thanks to badbeer. I met the brewer from Southampton, Phil Markowski, at GABF recently, and I've been impressed with everything I've tried from them so far. This was no exception. Copied from notes again after earlier rating was deleted.		A - Pours jet black and fairly thick with a small tan head and good lacing.		S - Aroma is roast, coffee, licorice, and some dark fruit. Smells very good.		T - Flavor is roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and a little anise. Very good and well-balanced, if not too intense. A little on the less sweet side for an imperial stout.		M - Silky smooth on the palate with medium full body and a little alcohol warmth.		D - Pretty drinkable for an imperial stout.",2009-10-06 18:26:56
6.8,37507,10485,Smokestack Heritage Porter,Smoked Beer,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,johnmichaelsen,4.0," This particular bottle had roughly a year under it's belt when I finally got around to opening it the other night. As I've never had the beer before, I'm not sure how aging the beer might have affected it. In any event...		The beer pours a blackish brown color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose I get leather, licorice, sweet malt and smoked meat. This beer smells pretty attractive, though it's a bit lighter then what I was expecting. The beer also smells as if it will be fairly dry, something that was confirmed when I took my first sip. Flavors on the palate generally replicate the nose, all on a moderately sweet frame. The finish is fairly dry, and mouthfeel is smooth, long and almost creamy. Drinkability is pretty good, and you can tell the abv. is not too high in this beer. The beer is very well balanced, and is not at all heavy or tiring on the palate. 		While nothing spectacular, this is an easy to enjoy and appreciate porter from East End Brewing. I drank the rest of the bottle a day after opening it, and if anything it might have been a bit better the next day. In any event, this is a nice enough smoked porter from East End.",2009-10-06 18:27:39

Roasted malt, coffee, cocoa, and even a little pine/citrus come through in the nose. The flavor is initially dominated by roasted malt, which gives way to some pine and cocoa, and then finishes with cocoa and coffee. Thinner body than expected, but still velvety and greatly satisfying, and very sessionable. Not much carbonation, as expected, given the cask, but man was this stout drinkable.",2009-10-06 18:28:08

A - Pours a dark reddish brown color with some tan foam and decent lacing.		S - Awesome aroma of bourbon, oak, vanilla, caramel, and brown sugar. This already seems like it's going to live up to the hype.		T - Similar to the aroma, with a great sweet caramel/toffee malt background, brown sugar, bourbon, oak, vanilla, and some dark fruits. There really is a lot going on in this beer.		M - Amazing palate - smooth creamy, and a little syrupy with medium-full body.		D - Way too high. This just keeps you wanting more.

A - Dark reddish brown pour with no head, just a ring, and not much lacing to speak of.		S - Aroma is very nice with brown sugar, coffee, dark fruits, and alcohol.		T - Sweet and fairly complex, with lots of brown sugar, caramel, and toffee, prune, raisin, oak, vanilla, and mild roast. This is a very sweet beer, but I like 'em that way sometimes.		M - Palate is smooth with medium body and minimal carbonation. Did Lost Abbey have a hand in this? Long finish though with some alcoholic warmth.		D - Pretty good.

Pours a cloudy dark yellow with a large frothy off-white head on top. Great retention. Leaves plenty of sticky lace. Smells of grass, lemons, sharp hops, and sour apples. 		The mouth was thin and lacking carbonation. Didn't care for the feel at all. Flavor was tart and grassy. Plenty of lemon zest in there, finishes mild. Hops at the forefront, but tamer than expected.

A - Dark, hazy orangish-brown color with a minimal off-white head.		S - Complex aroma of caramel malt, earth, brown sugar, dark fruit, banana, and Belgian yeast.		T - Sweet caramel malt, banana, fig, toffee, brown sugar, and mild hops. Some light fruity notes, pear and banana in particular, are also present. Alcohol noticeable on the finish but not bad for almost 15%.		M - Medium-full bodied and creamy. Low carbonation.		D - Average-plus.

The smell was dominated by spices, including coriander, black peppercorns, and a little ginger, backed by a malty biscuit aroma. The flavor was edgier, with the aforementioned spices leaping about; no real progression in the palate, just a big mix of spices swirling about. The mouthfeel was medium as expected, with very little carbonation, if any, making this a decently sessionable brew, if not for the intense mix of spices.",2009-10-06 18:37:02

This one pours a very nice, light, ruby color with golden brown tinting. Three-fingers of creamy tan foam make the head. It recedes to a thin surface covering. Lacing is thick and fairly sticky.		This has to be one of the best smelling beers I've ever had. It smells wonderful. The yams and spices are most noticable, but the maple notes also come out nicely. There's also something else....pecans, maybe?		This is delicious! Wonderful yam flavors shine through. The spices are very nice and right out in the open. They are balanced by a very nice maple flavor and sweetness. A very mild hint of molasses keeps it all grounded. All of this sits on top of a nice malty base.		Full-bodied with a medium-to-full level of carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink. It has a nice level of creaminess, which I like.		The abv level is a bit high. While I don't taste it, I am certainly starting to feel it, at the halfway point in this 25oz. bottle. Other than that though, it's super tasty and easy to drink.",2009-10-06 18:37:17

I assume it must be from last winter.		A - Pours a dark reddish-amber color with a large beige head and absolutely insane lacing. I mean clumps of foam cling to the side of the glass, and distinct rings can be seen well after the beer is gone.		S - Aroma is brown sugar, honey, spices, citrusy and resinous hops. You get both winter warmer and IPA, which is very interesting.		T - Flavor is brown sugar, caramel, maple syrup, honey, holiday spices, juniper, and grapefruity, resinous hops in just the right amount, not too intense. This winter warmer/DIPA combo is an interesting one, and this attempt at it is well-executed.		M - Palate is smooth and just a tiny bit syrupy, with soft carbonation.		D - Pretty high.

8.5,695,222,Duvel,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,Paisan,5.0," ""Duvel"", Flemish (not Dutch!) for ""devil"", is very aptly named, for this can be a sneaky little bastard. This beer is so drinkable, and the alcohol so well hidden that you tend to forget this is 8.5 ABV, and before you know it, it bites you in the lower posterior regions.		Pour this gently (sediment!) in its tulip glass, and you will create a whirlpool of gold, a tornado in a field of barley under a towering white cloud - and just like the weather in Flanders, this cloud will not easily disappear.	After the rising rain has stopped, you notice the nearby orchard, you can smell the apples and pears.	And then you get high on the bittersweet sensation of being part of and immersion in Nature's abundance.		This will quench your thirst any time: aperitif, with your meal, digestif, on a sunny terrace... The well-present bitterness of the fine hops is nicely balanced by the slight sweetness of the alcohol - the only indication you'll get of its presence... until it's too late.		This is most definitely not an average beer, but luckily in Belgium this is an EVERYDAY beer!	This is one every beer afficionado should try, over and over. Schol!",2009-10-06 18:47:04

A little sweet, and a little bit of yeast smell. Not really a lot of hops prevalent, especially considering that they list is as a Pale Ale.		T: A tart yeast taste comes out first, then a hop finish. Not quite as hoppy as you would think for a pale ale, but still drinkable.		M: Medium Bodied, carbonation good for the style.		D: Overall it is decent, but not amazing.

9.6,2671,140,Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale,American Barleywine,4.0,4.5,4.0,5.0,donniecuffs,5.0," Let me preface this review by saying that I do not usually care for barleywines. Not that the style is a bad one, but moreso because I find that brewers in general tend to make this style so syrupy and sweet that it makes me feel like I am drinking flavored maple syrup. 		Anyway, I recently sampled the 2004 vintage on tap, and it was delightful. It poured a nice reddish-brown, with a thin off-white head, little lacing, and little carbonation, if any. The smell was a poutpourri of both dark fruit (date, raisin, plum) and citrus (red orange, lime, pink grapefruit), as well as some malty biscuit, and the flavor revealed all of these in more generous quantities. However the flavor was not overpoweringly sweet, and the mouthfeel, while thick-bodied, was not syrupy. This might be one of the only sessionable barleywines I have ever come across, but of course beware the alcohol content. 		Final note...of course the five year-old nature of this brew most likely smoothened out the feel and flavor, so I'd like to try and sample a more recent vintage to discern the aging effect.",2009-10-06 18:53:40

Smells of coffee roasted malt, slight alchohol scent, toffee and mocha aroma. 		Deep chocolate flavor with sweetness that makes your teeth almost hurt. Coffee, toffee and everything that should be represented by a RIS, I was amazed at the thick mouthfeel and the deep flavors from a 4.99 bomber. Can't wait to go back and stock up on a couple of these to save for later this fall/Winter. 		I could drink two of these, but would probably not want to in one sitting.",2009-10-06 18:59:39

A - Deep slightly hazy red color with a small white head.		S - Tart with fresh raspberry and oak. Very nice, but not too much to it really.		T - Flavor is fresh sour raspberries, oak, vanilla, and some funk. The Bullfrog mafia hyped this beer up like crazy, and it was in fact pretty solid - but not THAT good		M - Body is medium with a sharp acidic bite and fairly high carbonation.		D - Better than average. This is a good sour but not a game-changer.",2009-10-06 18:59:48

No plans to stay but when he offered me a struise beer I didn't know yet.... well... why refuse.		A: Poured into a WV glass. A hazy dark yellow color with a head that I missed since I looked in another direction (for 3 seconds) while rvdoorn poured the beer.		S: It's rather fruity, something herbal and clearly a dark candi sugar sweetness.		T: Wow, the taste of fresh yellow fruits. Similarities with the Westmalle extra. Dark candi sugar again, orange zest. The slowly growing bitternest makes the orange sensation almost a grapefruit one.		M: Low carbonation with a dry finish. A light but very pleasant body.		D: Just great. Could go with this beer whole night.",2009-10-06 19:00:25
4.3,28751,13302,Porkslap Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4.5,2.0,4.5,4.0,Buebie,3.5," Picked up at the WF Bowery for $1.99 a single.		Poured from a neat little 12 oz can, hilarious can design!	Went into a pub glass. Presentation off the pour is stellar. Bif frothy 2'' foam filled head, slow to recede. Leaving ample thick lace. Color is terrific, a nice hazy unfiltered look, new copper color with mild amber reddish hues. A solid cap with even thicker collar is left behind in retention. Like I said, terriffic appearance on this. 		Aroma is almost non-existent, mild caramel sweetness, some mild hop aroma and a touch of minerally water. But its very subdued and hard to detect without a swirl of the glass to force aroma to come through. In which case I did, but then lost all my beautiful lace. :(		Taste isnt bad really, sweet bready malted goodness mixing with plenty of caramel sweetness and a mild sweet cream butter flavor. Hops come through at the swallow, although still mild as well. Bittering into the finish with a mild linger of pine and earthy hop spice. 	Mouthfeel is full bodied with a touch of carbonation zing. 		For an apa the aroma is pretty mild, presentation is great and flavors are by the book. Its no award winning apa, but its a sessionable beer that is also very easy drinking. Decent example of the style. I enjoyed a 6 pack over a night in the hotel of this. Definatly kept me satisfied.",2009-10-06 19:03:47
5.0,3558,140,Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager,Czech Pilsener,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,donniecuffs,3.5," Poured into an American pint glass, very yellow/gold, with good carbonation, but a thin white head and no lacing. The smell was lackluster, with just a subtle hint of lemon, and some herbal/grassy notes. The taste was the same, with a slightly more pronounced herbal presence rather than citrus. The mouthfeel was a pleasantly thin, carbonated brew; certainly refreshing for a 'lawnmower' beer, and definitely sessionable. However, it does need some more flavor.",2009-10-06 19:13:30

5.0,53159,765,Trafalgar Hop Nouveau 2009,American Pale Ale (APA),3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,bobsy,3.0," Viggo brought this bottle over - a stain on his otherwise impeccable record.		For those who don't know, Trafalgar is far from the best brewery in our province. They have had trouble with infected beers, and even when they are in good shape they're pretty bad examples of what they are supposed to be. Hop Nouveau continues that trend.		Pours a clear gold with a thin white head that had reasonable retention and laid down some fingers of lace. The aroma still manages to smell crap despite including creamy malt, mango, flowers and earthy citrus hops. There's just something run of the mill to it. Likewise, the flavour suffers from a lack of a solid malt base. What there is seems too weak and almost corny. The hops come through with herbal tones and some pine, but the bitterness is more or less AWOL compared to other fresh hopped beers. Its a bit mediocre, but good for this brewery. Mouthfeel is too light and watery.		Another fail.",2009-10-06 19:13:48
5.8,32007,13165,Black Wattle Superior Wattle Seed Ale,Herbed / Spiced Beer,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.5,VicCherikoff,2.0," Wattleseed beer is better made using the extract added to a light flavored beer eg witbier. This way the chocolate, coffee, hazelnut of true Wattleseed comes through after the hops and malt of the beer, cleansing the palate and complementing the flavors of the beer.

Almost forgot to re-enter this after the beer was accidentally nuked.		Looks pretty good for a english brown ale, pouring a rich chestnut with a finger of off-white head that puts down some nice lace. Brown bread aroma, mixing in with dark fruit and chocolate.

M - fairly light feeling, but a little more weight than a domestic light beer.		D - quite drinkable. Not overwhelming at all.. I've had two here at the bar while I wait for the girl to show up, and I could go for a third.		Overall I'm not blown away, but I'm not dissapointed either.

4.7,51000,467,Summit KÃ¶lsch,KÃ¶lsch,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,steveh,5.0," My first foray into the new Unchained Series from Summit. My first impression? It's Summit -- let's not go craft crazy with the pricing here, $8.30 a sixer? Bad enough it's $8, why the .30?		A -- Nice, clear, pale gold with a dense off-white head.		S -- Spicy hops with some vague DMS back, even a little sulfur belying freshness.		T -- There's a vague sweet malt hit up front, then grassy, spicy noble hops take over the palate, and everything finishes in a hop bitter and grainy balance -- even some lemony fruit and floral hop character making itself known with warming. All mighty complex and subtly smooth at the same time in a little 4.7 ABV beer from the North Woods.		M -- Light body with a mouthfeel that starts soft and ends dry and crisp.		D -- Drinkability would be exceptional, but the dry, spicy hop bitterness is almost too dry to be refreshing. Then again, this is probably the best take on the Klsch style from a micro that I've ever tried -- and Goose Island Summertime is one of my favorite beers. Is it worth $1.40 a bottle? Yeah, I suppose so, especially when you consider it's probably $4.50 a pint at the local.",2009-10-06 19:26:11
8.5,53167,30,DuganA IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,GarrisWH,4.5," A - Pours a slightly hazed golden-orange with a two finger, creamy off-white head. Great retention and lacing.		S - Fresh hop aroma apparent on pouring, consisting of citrus, pine, and floral notes. Just a hint of sweet malt in the background, letting the delicious hop aromas dominate.		T - Nice, bitter hop kick up front with a citrus character, a bit of white grapefruit and tangerine in there. The sweet, caramel malt comes through a bit in the middle, lending just enough balance to keep things in check. Finish is dry and bitter and leads into a rather resinous, piney aftertaste. Not much alcohol apparent in the flavor. Very nice, crisp, hop-heavy flavor. I like.		M - Medium bodied with a crisp carbonation. Quite resinous and bitter. Really fits the style well.		D - For 8.5% ABV, this beer is very drinkable. Nice combination of flavors and would surely please most hop-heads.",2009-10-06 19:27:39

Appearance: Very clear amber with large stark white head and nice lacing.		Smell: Dry spice, fruit, tea, sour bread and English hops.		Taste: Light fruit, bread and tea-like malts with some English spice counterbalance. Wow, very tea-like and somewhat tart and musty.		Feel: Low to moderate carbonation, relatively light body, exceedingly dry.		Drinkability: Great English pub ale, but I have absolutely no idea what style this is.

Aroma is a nice amount of citrus hops in front of sweet malts. The taste is an interesting blend of citrus hops with sweet pale malts and slight sweet fruits.

7.0,2751,610,Racer 5 India Pale Ale,American IPA,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,Buebie,4.5," picked up this bomber from WF Bowery for $4.99		Poured the bottle into a pint glass. 1'' white froth comenses to sit there for several minutes. Receding to leave bubbly head of globby bubbles protruding from the surface. Nice sticky lace covering the glass in a sponge pattern. 	Appearance of color is identical to an all 2-row and cara 20*L looking like a harmless little beer with nothing to show, but actually hiding a monster below the surface!		Aroma is all about hops, bursting juicy fruity delicious hops, mixing with malt though and remaining sweet. My experience with these beers tells me the flavors will be nothing but bitter, destroy your pallet in your face hops. 		I was wrong! This thing is balanced! Taste is soo hoppy, yet sweet, yet malty and caramel filled delicious! Hops bite all the way through, while malt and 2 row keep things somwhat sweet. Its crisp and refreshing. Hops in flavor are mostly bitter with not much in the way of citric floral taste. Its pine and bitter hops all the way through.	Mouthfeel is a bit more full bodied with a backing of mild creamyness. Carbonation tickle keeps the mouthfeel balanced even. God, this is a great beer. Its drinakeable without hop overload and still has great hop flavor and bitters.

5.3,52633,35,Samuel Adams Coastal Wheat,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,bump8628,3.0," 12 oz bottle with best before March notched on the label.		Poured into a pilsener glass with a rich golden color and an inch of creamy white head.		The aroma is a blend of cracker-like wheat malt and a faint citrus character presumably from the lemon peel. Its not too interesting or complex, but I generally don't expect much in this style.		The taste is a bit of a let down. It is predominately composed of a bland, crackery, wheat character. Hop bitterness and overall hop character is low. The lemon peel is well done in the sense that it isn't overwhelming, but it just doesn't add much to this insipid beer. There is a slight dry astringency to the finish and the mouthfeel is pretty watery.		I don't really understand the thinking behind this new release from Sam Adams. If you want to put out an American wheat why not just make summer ale a year around beer? In my opinion, it's a significantly better beer than this one. I'd like to see brewing companies with the stability and means of Boston Beer Company to push the boundaries of beer rather than continue to release dumbed-down versions of already over-brewed styles.",2009-10-06 20:15:48

Poured a dark orange color, with a nice white head that left some decent lacing on my Fat Heads Pittsburgh pint glass.		Nice hoppy smell, can smell some rye, but not extremely noticable.		Again, nice hoppy taste, with a nice small rye taste at the end. As some descriptions say, definitely more of an APA than a rye.		Average mouthfeel, with an overall good drinkability.

9.5,45328,5318,Panzer Imperial Pilsner,American Double / Imperial Pilsner,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,corby112,2.0," On tap at the Belgian Cafe		Pours a hazy cloudy bright golden yellow with a one finger frothy white head that quickly settles into a lasting ring, leaving sporadic patches of soapy lacing.		Aroma is very hoppy, especially for the style with a very strong alcohol presence as well as bready yeast, pilsner malt and some earthy grass/straw notes.		This beer is very hop forward and lingers into a bready yeasty body with a decent pilsner malt backbone. Slight earthy grass notes are followed by a very astringent strong alcohol finish. I don't really know how you could call this a pilsner. It seems like they pitched some pilsner malt into some kind of hoppy alcohol juice. Way too hoppy and too much of an alcohol presence. The body is full with some of the above mentioned bready yeast but the ABV is not masked at all. This beer is kind of a sloppy mess. They just hopped up some ingredients and slapped the word imperial on there. Avoid this one.",2009-10-06 20:20:22

Not much in the way of lacing.		Rosted malt aroma with some biscuit and rye notes as well as some subtle floral hops. Kind of bland with not much standing out.		Again the flavor is kind of bland. Slightly watered down with a caramel and rye character with some toasty biscuit notes balanced out by subtle floral hops. There's nothing special about this beer and seems to be made for drinking in large session rather than a profound sipper.,2009-10-06 20:32:34

There was good retention and sticky lacing. 		The smell featured an herbal and piney hop with a hidden doughiness. 		The taste was upfront herbal hop spice that soon gave way to a thin graininess. 		The mouthfeel was toward the lighter side of the style with a clean aftertaste. 		Overall a hop forward ale that lacks slightly in malt depth. Clean finish was pretty amazing however.",2009-10-06 20:34:22
3.1,43889,16866,Hottenroth Berliner Weisse,Berliner Weissbier,3.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,younger35,4.5," Received this brew recently from the every generous Gibby. I love The Bruery and after drinking New Glarus's Berliner Weiss, I'm a fan of those too. Drank from my Ithaca Excelsior tulip while watching Minnesota vs. Green Bay on Monday Night Football (F bomb I hate Brett Favre... but go Vikings).		Appearance- Pours a super hazy light yellowish white with a big two finger head that is bright white and super creamy. The beer is super effervescent but manages to maintain no cap collar or lacing.	Smell- Super wheaty (or floury) and grainy. The brew actually smells like dried corn that has been crushed during harvest back in good ol' Illinois. Slightly vinegary and tart in the nose with a subtle white wine like aspect. Doesn't smell particularly sour but I guess well soon find out.	Taste- Starts lightly tart and semi vinous with a berry like bite right from the start. Like the nose it's grainy and raw with that crushed maize and flour like characteristic. Starts very clean and sharp with a light white grape and peach aspect. Finishes almost the exact opposite as it starts, once the tartness fades a light dirty earthiness sets in. That earthiness seems to linger well into the finish along with an abundance of that raw grain.	Mouthfeel- Thin but the carbonation is strong lending itself to the smaller body making for a nice feel and what I'd expect from a beer of this type.	Drinkability- Sitting at 3.1% this thing isn't going to be anywhere near hard to drink. The beer is lightly tart and super refreshing and oh so delicious. Honestly I think I like New Glarus's a TAD better since it's filtered and has less of that floury/wheat bite. Either way, lame bitching aside, great beer. Thanks Jeff!",2009-10-06 20:36:10

5.2,1882,216,Rodenbach Classic (Red),Flanders Red Ale,4.0,4.5,5.0,4.5,Paisan,4.5," A sour and a Belgian red.	It pours with a nice head, but this disappears almost immediately.	The smell is... complex; there is a lot going on there. There's plenty of dark and red fuits: cherries, plums, berries, also some vanilla, caramel, grapes. You can't help but make a comparison with wine, and it holds up really well; I'm inclined to agree this is a wine among the beers.	The taste is sour, but not overly, it has enough sweetness to make this most drinkable. If you're thirsty, get yourself a Rodenbach, it is most refreshing.",2009-10-06 20:39:55
10.0,44755,10097,Harpoon Leviathan - Imperial IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.5,4.0,2.5,4.0,pinotboy007,4.0," A - Deep golden-orange w/a georgeous, rocky, chunky head and sticky lace. 		S - Plenty of piney and citrus-laden hops, and a sweet malt fragrance.		T - Big hop oil and citrus with very sweet malt and brown sugar/oaky maple syrup. 		M- Dense and silky with decent carbonation. Alcohol is there for sure but doesn't burn. 		D- Maybe for dessert or with a stogie. Way too high ABV and too sweet for my taste.",2009-10-06 20:43:27
10.2,50853,273,Sweetwater Dank Tank DP Barleywine Ale,American Barleywine,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,younger35,4.0," Received this brew from MMAJYK as one of many many extras in a recent trade. Anything that has anything to do with a Donkey Punch has GOT to be good, right? Drank from my Ithaca Excelsior tulip while watching the Bills vs Patriots.		Appearance- Pours a hazy yellowish orange with a big white head that is creamy and thick. Not much of a cap remains but a big thick collar sits atop the brew leaving almost zero lacing.	Smell- Great big burst of rich creamy caramel that jumps out of bottle upon opening. I'm not sure I've smelled anything so rich and inviting. Reminds me of a Milky Way bar. Somewhat buttery and smooth before the hops enter the equation. Light pine and some fairly aggressive citrus peak through with something hiding in the background that reminds me of green apple. Maybe even a flash of pineapple.	Taste- Starts with a big hoppy bite that is sweet at times and bitter at others. Probably more toward bitter at first as the hops are very citric and crisp. Pine sap and spearmint jump in right from the get go leaving a very herbally like taste in the mouth. Grapefruit, pineapple and even a bit apricot all sneak in within that citrus-ness. Plenty of malt to back everything up though as the caramel maltiness is plenty assertive. At some point that malt gets semi sweet as an almost buttered popcorn aspect jumps in. Finishes lightly spicy from the alcohol with a sort of herbally sweetness.	Mouthfeel- Surprisingly light for how big this brew is but it is over 10%. The carbonation is very low as the beer finishes with a considerable warmness.	Drinkability- This is a big beer that is full of big ol' flavors. They weren't kidding when they say they threw the kitchen sink in this bad boy. The hops are damn near violent and the malt is over the top. If you have a friend this is a good brew to share. I had a hard time putting down this bomber. Thanks very much for the opportunity Marc!",2009-10-06 20:43:46
6.5,355,132,Dead Guy Ale,Maibock / Helles Bock,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,mtbbaboon,4.5," I hadn't had Dead Guy Ale in a while, so I decided to be crazy and buy a six pack. I forgot how good this beer is. Pours a cloudy light orange color. Not a huge head, but plenty there. It's got a sweet and slightly spicy smell. Not a whole lot of hops in the nose, but plenty of malt It tastes really good. Definitely high on the malt and little more subdues with the hops. The taste starts off slightly sweet (caramel) but gives way to spice and bitterness. A lot happening there and it all comes together beautifully. Medium mouthfeel. Nice and clean. Very drinkable. I'm glad I decided to pick up this six pack. I don't remember liking this beer as much the last time I had it.",2009-10-06 20:50:50
6.2,53172,11031,Vuur & Vlam,American IPA,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,wl0307,4.0," Purchased at the BSF bar, GBBF 2009; this bottle-conditioned ale comes in a 330ml slim brown bottle, BB 2014, served faintly chilled in Tripel Karmeliet's long-stemmed tulip-shaped goblet. NOTE: much information about this beer is printed on the front label - Brewed on 29 April 2009, Bottled on 2 June 2009; EBC 22.2, EBU 42.6; Bitter-ing hops Galena + as late-hops - Chinook, Cascade, Simcoe and Amarillo + Dry-hopping with Cascade; this bottle is No. 51 from the batch of 1344 bottles only. The label actually looks like some freshly printed ""laboratory briefing""...?!		A: a huge and foamy light beige froth sits on top of a moderately carbonated, slightly murky dark amber hue. Phenomenal.	S: the smell is more like a well-hopped Tripel with a bit more malt sweetness upfront; as indicated by the front label, the hop composition is indeed complex and hard to ""dissect"" for analysis, featuring Cascade et al. US hops' piney, apricot-ish, grapefruity & lychee-ish aroma, while Belgian/Dutch exotic yeasts also render a rich flower-estery & spicy (a touch of vanilla and coriander-seeds) aura in the background. In the middle is a more settled layer of overripe fruits (pears, bananas, and pineapples [smoothie like!]) and mixed, toffee-ish+sugary malts. Very pleasant and tremendously hoppy, but the malt syrup is equally rich to provide a kind of gravity.	T: the effervescent mouthful of spicy-bitter & powdery yeastiness and piney hops is refreshing and kicking my taste-buds hard, waking them up to a dry, citrus-peel-ish spicy-bitter aftertaste that ensues closely, as does a vanilla-ish herbal note... Also in the aftertaste, the bready+caramely malts develop by stealth, but way less significant on a balance already dominated by lingering lychee-shell-ish aroma and chewy, spicy, medium+ level of bitterness from both hops and yeast sediments. Surprisingly, at merely 6.2%abv., this ale should leave an interestingly warmer-than-average swallow as it goes down the throat!	M&D: refreshing and semi-lively carbonated with very fine fizz, giving an elevating effect on the flavour actually. The complex hop profile is all mixed up in terms of flavour, and then engulfed by the rich yeastiness that I couldn't have avoided even if a more gentle pour was applied, as the yeast sediments are by no means settled in the bottle - more in line with a Belgian/Dutch bottled ale. The combined effect makes a heavily hopped and yet immensely yeasty semi-IPA style of ale.",2009-10-06 20:55:21
6.5,49058,10321,Red Racer IPA,American IPA,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,DrDogbeer,4.5," Poured from the funky green can. Seriously looks like a juice or soda can. Pours a crystal clear orange/gold with a fluffy white head. Smell is wonderful west coast ipa pine and citrus love! Not an overpowering scent but lovely. Taste is similar to the aromas with lots of pine and grapefruit up front, but this one does not kill you with the bitterness. A sweet light malt backbone makes it insanely drinkable. Just a wonderful beer and I am stoked it is now available here!",2009-10-06 20:56:48
7.0,36298,81,Van Vollenhoven's Stout,Foreign / Export Stout,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,wl0307,3.5," Purchased at the BSF bar, GBBF 2008; coming in a slim brown 330ml bottle, bottle-conditioned; brewed in 2007 and BB 01/11/2008, served mildly chilled in Gulden Draak's tulip-shaped sniffer.		A: the beer storms out of the bottle as soon as the cap was 10% opened... but still I've managed to get most of the beer in the glass, in its nearly black hue and topped with a tan frothy head settling slowly to a thin cap to last. Needless to say, the carbonation is lively.	S: dusty, roast- & chocolate-malty with plenty of black-sugary notes; the rather restrained yet hard-to-miss estery aroma comes in the form of black prunes and fat black dates - not quite pronounced as many other Belgian take on the style. A swirl brings out a little alc. and (surprisingly) hints of flowery hops, while sweet bitter chocolates, more roast grains and sour-ish notes of roast malts stay firmly in the background to be appreciated. Very pleasant overall.	T: sour-ish black coffee, semi-smoky aroma and toasted malts dominate the foretaste, then quietly the herbal touch of hops, residual aromatic chocolaty malts and faintly sour black fruits ensue, before all's wrapped up in a lightly chewy finish consisting of bitter-sweet malts, attenuated hop bitterness, and mild aroma as of Chinese smoked prunes. What's consistent throughout the drink is the key touch of sourness, quite vital to help retain a light palate, I think.	M&D: all's well in this beer - it's well made, it has all the usual elements of a strong stout, it's mellow on the alc. side, it has a decent support from the hops and the medium body makes it more than drinkable. However, it fails to strike the chord with my expectation of a potent, complex English stout and also fails to stand out as an interestingly yeasty Belgian/Dutch take on the style. Not on top of my to-drink list, yet with all honesty this ale is very easy-drinking indeed.",2009-10-06 21:01:11
5.5,5749,559,Untouchable Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,plaid75,4.0," On draft at The Pony Bar, NYC. 		Poured a light copper hue with a half finger foamy white head. There was decent retention and lacing. 		The smell featured a soft cereal grain and light herbal hop. 		The taste consisted of a smooth light caramel with a flowery and slightly herbal hop. 		The mouthfeel was typical of the style. 		Overall a tasty and well balaced APA.",2009-10-06 21:01:50
9.4,47695,14879,Barrel Aged B.O.R.I.S. Oatmeal Imperial Stout,Russian Imperial Stout,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,BuckeyeNation,4.5," Charred oak barrel black with no highlights whatsoever. No how, no way. The magnificent cap of foam is the color of a double chocolate fudge milkshake and looks to be as creamy and as thick. It melts in super-slow motion and is absolutely plastering the glass with lace. Yeah, but is it perfect? Yessiree.		If the aroma is any indication, Fred left B.O.R.I.S. in the whiskey barrels for precisely the right length of time. The roasted maltiness of the base RIS is easily appreciated alongside the beautiful burnt sugar and vanilla notes imparted by the barrels. This is shaping up to be one gobsmacker of a stout.		Regular B.O.R.I.S. needs a re-review in the worst way. I had a feeling that my experience on the day of that review wasn't what it should have been (because I was lucky enough to taste the beer right out of the tanks on a visit to the brewery). I say that because simply aging this beast in whiskey barrels couldn't have improved it this much. Even without the bourbon, it's a remarkable RIS. A bodacious one even.		The flavor profile can only be described as thunderous, thanks to what tastes like several metric tons of roasted and black malt. There aren't too many versions with this much dark chocolatiness. Other flavors include espresso, blackstrap molasses, dark caramel, vanilla beans and coconut. The flavor and bitterness of the hops gives it that edge that puts it over the top. Even more whiskey would have been welcome, but the beer is still amazing.		The mouthfeel was flirting with the next lowest score until the last few mouthfuls. Warming firms things up, smooths them out and adds a luscious creaminess akin to... well... heavy cream. Laid back bubbles are dead solid perfect.		Barrel Aged B.O.R.I.S. is Hoppin' Frog's best beer (and they brew some beauties). It has everything that I look for in a bourbon barrel aged Russian Imperial Stout, and then some. Here's hoping that Mr. Karm releases it yearly. And that some kind Ohio BA will hook me up if I'm not able to make it back in time to clear out a few stores.",2009-10-06 21:04:21
10.0,53171,612,Collaborative Evil 2009,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,4.0,3.5,5.0,4.0,bluemoonswoon,4.5," Review number 500 and couldn't really think of a better beer to try than a highly sought after beer from a highly sought after brewery.		Served in a goblet.		A: Comes out clean and clear out of the tap, topped with a meringue-like bleached white head, very soft looking but drawn tight over the body of the beer, leaves behind some wonderful Belgian lacing though the entire drinking session. The beer itself is a light rose tinted orange and looks incredibly beguiling sitting in front of me at the edge of the bar.		S: This is the only week spot for me, but perhaps I had to fight off too many other aromas, like the food from the bar and other things that could have possibly distracted my nose. Knowing this the aroma seems a bit muted, honey, hibiscus flower, orange blossoms with a delicate and sugary maltiness, I am straining in these comparisons as all these aromas are quite faint and after the initial sip the aromas seem to dissipate completely from the beer, but what you get initially shows quite a bit of promise.		T/MF: Feels wonderful crossing the tongue, smooth, slightly bubbly that wraps around your tongue, floats just above the taste buds and leaves just the slightest bit of sticky sweetness on the back of the tongue that practically dares you to try not gulping this beer down in one sip. Taste is just as good. It's listed at 10.5% but you could have fooled me. This beer is so incredibly easy to drink, light on the stomach and head but not on feel or taste, a kind of balance that I could only dream of recreating myself. I'm getting bits of honey, orange blossom, and mix between herbal and floral fruitiness.		D: Could drink this all day long if it were not for the ABV because even though I can't taste it, I'm positive that it would catch up with me eventually. I am really hoping I can snag a few bottles of this when it is released in bottles. A beer to seek out and a wonderful beer milestone at that.",2009-10-06 21:06:11
11.0,53173,11890,Emelisse Double IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,wl0307,3.5," Purchased at the BSF bar, GBBF 2009, this bottle-conditioned ale comes in a short, slim brown bottle (likely 300ml); bottled on 11 June 2009, served mildly chilled in Orval's broad-rimmed chalice. NOTE: ingredients include biscuit malt, pale malt, Fuggles and Amarillo hops; at 80 EBU.		A: pours a translucent, dark amber hue with very fine carbonation in action, topped with a nice foamy light beige froth, leaving even sheets of lacing as it slowly retreats.	S: the bottle-conditioning yeasts have apparently clouded the aroma in the most aggressive way, rendering a dense aura of sour/oxidised pears & citric fruits plus sour breadiness, on top of a relatively restrained cake-ish+biscuity malt base. The Amarillo and Fuggles hops as described on the front label are nowhere to be found, susceptibly buried underneath the yeasty layer... In a way, the smell reminds me of a few yeasty and super strong, poorly bottle-conditioned barley wines that I've tasted in southern England!	T: quite like the aroma, the creamy-effervescent foretaste is full of sour pears+apples, sour bread, sour lactose drink, and cake-ish/syrupy malt (as in a traditional barley wine) - not quite unpleasant, but very different from one's expectation of a ""DIPA""... After the creamy & thick swallow gradually settles, a light stream of orangey-citric hop juice ensues along with a soothingly bitter, zesty-tangy and lightly earthy undertone of hops... In turn, as the flavour evaporates, the bitterness sets in and deepens to result in a somewhat rough, chewy and dry palate in the finish, as the belated reminder of some depth of hops (EBU 80).	M&D: despite being refreshing with creamy carbonation and much lighter in body than the 9%abv. leads one to believe, the unsettled yeast sediments in the bottle have undoubtedly compromised the performance of flavour big time... What's left to be enjoyed is the minimum one would expect from a high-gravity and supposedly heavily-hopped ""Double IPA"" - its chewy bitter undertones in the finish. Apart from this, the flavour simply fails to deliver other good elements amidst the intervention of yeast sediments. What a shame. Maybe a (roughly) filtered or draught version of this ale might taste much better, hopefully?",2009-10-06 21:06:40
7.0,7097,997,Brewer's Art Resurrection,Dubbel,4.5,4.0,4.0,5.0,younger35,4.0," Received this brew from masterchiefmd in a trade not so long back. This will be my first brew from Brewer's Art and until I got this, I've never heard of them. Drank from my Lost Abbey goblet.		Appearance- Pours a light pinkish copper with a semi tannish pink three finger head. An amazing cap and collar remain the entire beer along with plenty of thick lacing.	Smell- Fairly yeasty in the nose with some light fruity esters and spice wafting about. A tinge of alcohol in nostrils as well. Maybe a light bit of sugary sweetness but honestly the yeast just dominates. 	Taste- Starts with a slightly sweet yeastiness that is somewhere between fruity and dirty. A bit of light brown sugar and/or Belgium candy as well. The malt is caramely and really not as rich as the smell sort of led me to believe. A slight bitterness sneaks in toward the middle which is surprising considering the sugars and malty nature of the brew. Lightly spicy to finish as the yeast is peppery and lightly fruity. The alcohol is honestly non existent in the taste. Surprised to read it's not like 4% or something.	Mouthfeel- Amazing all around. It manages to somehow have a fairly aggressive carbonation that is amazingly light and airy on the tongue. Lighter body that could probably be tuned up a hair but the overall feel is great.	Drinkability- I really enjoyed this brew. It's very easy drinking and has an amazing mouthfeel. It definitely doesn't have the intense sort of big flavor that most dubbels have but I think I'd prefer this. Just a nice beer that was an even nicer surprise. Thanks!",2009-10-06 21:10:55

Poured clear yellow gold, with a small white head, Minimal foam retention, thinnest string of lace. Fruity sweet aroma, Blueberry really camer through nicely. Taste has the blueberries, but well balanced with the breay malt. Enough bitterness at the end to keep it from being to sugary sweet. Average body and carbonation, appropriate. Good drinkablility, not over sweet or artificial tasting. Would be a good summer beer, or pair with a fruit dessert.",2009-10-06 21:12:08
5.5,47586,447,McSorley's Irish Black Lager,Schwarzbier,1.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,saztheorybook,2.0," A- Looks exactly like cola, an almost-black brown with no ""fizz"" after the initial burst. Even my vigorous pour only encouraged about a half a finger's worth of head, suspect because of the plethora of bubbles covering my glass and a head that dissipates in seconds with zero lacing.		S-Caramel and aluminum notes. Obviously the head this the source of most volatiles but there is little to no smell after the head vanishes so quickly.		T- Decent malt profile with a nice roasted flavor that outlasts the negative flavors into the finish. At times there are notes of dirt/grass. Maybe a little DMS, too. This is pretty astringent and a little bit chemical. 		M-I could chug this if it weren't for the astringency, but as it stands, it could only be truly quaffable with a sausage in the other hand.		D-I'd get this at a festival and drink it from the bottle. Honestly, I think this might taste better that way. It was cheap, and it's okay, but I don't think I would buy another one at a beer store or restaurant, even though it was relatively cheap.",2009-10-06 21:12:46

Smell: Very cirtusy and spicy with some whiffs of yeast and banana.		Taste: The citrus hits you up front and finishes with a bit of malty bitterness. Not as complex as other offerings from Chimay, in my opinion, but still very tasty. 		Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy and fairly carbonated.

,43456,590,Unplugged Berliner Weiss,Berliner Weissbier,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,thederek,5.0," Wow. I've gone through a little over two cases since this summer. In fact I picked up the last supply of bottles I could find in kenosha County about two months ago. Amazing beer to come home to after a hard bike-ride. Sure beats a sports drink.		I'm a little hazy after downing a couple of Dogfish Head Punkins and don't really feel like pilfering my quickly dwindling supply of these fine brews, but from what I can recall (last one I imbibed was two weeks ago), this is a very light, zippy, citrusy wheat ale with a pale golden color. Looks like a sparkling lemonade or a sparkling wine.. Even drinks that way, sort of. Drinking out of a Pint Glass or a Weizen Glass, you're guaranteed to get a big gulp of the large head with the first taste. Sooo good. But the head subsides quickly leaving a few creamy curds ringing the glass and floating at the top of the liquid.The taste is very light and refreshing, with a great citrusy aroma, and a very effervescent mouthfeel. I could pound one of these in about three gulps, and could easily do two or three more in a sitting. Right now I find myself doing two per session. The first one I inhale, and the second I force myself to savor. Do yourself a favor and find one of these. Hopefully New Glarus brings this back next summer. I know my supply won't last that long!!",2009-10-06 21:16:11

S - A light smell of sweet, woody, fruity malts. Raisin and grape notes are present.		T - First impression is not good: like sucking on a penny. Serious metallic taste issues - not cool.

This beer is a semi-hazy brown liquid with ruby highlights and a thin head that doesn't leave much lacing.		The nose is all barrel. Tons of oak, spicy alcohol, vanilla, coconut, some dark dried fruits are present as well.		The first sip is a wooden fist to the face. Lot's of tannic characters, vanilla, soaked oak, coconut, burnt sugars, sweet malts, lot's of boozy heat, caramel. It's hard to tell what beer this was before it hit the barrel. There's some hop bitterness present as well in the finish.		The mouthfeel is full and slick and low carbonation and finishes very sticky.		A very interesting beer to try, but I enjoyed fresh Oatgoop better. I had a hard time finishing this beer. The booze and barrel really choked this one out.",2009-10-06 21:23:06

S - The hop aroma is mainly a grapefruit type citrus smell with a little pine. Otherwise it smells quite sweet and a little biscuit/bready.		T - Despite being a little old it still holds up. Muted citrus and pine flavors from the hops backed up by a sweet caramel and bready malt base.		M/D - A little sticky but I'm not surprised by that from an IPA.

Deep, rich gold amber color, solid inch of whitish foam. Good retention and sticky lace, a nice suprise. Lots of hop character in the aroma. Herbal, graperuit, and pine.

8.6,52441,147,Stone 09.09.09 Vertical Epic Ale,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,5.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,alcstradamus,3.5," Near black pour with a mountainous 3 finger head that is as fluffy as a marshmallow and lasts for quite a while. Good lacing left behind as well. Exceptional.		First smell is light spices and citrus mostly. Not really catching any chocolate on the nose other than weak traces of cocoa powder. Actually, scratch that...some agitation combined with a bit of warming brings out a little bit of milk chocolate.		As this first hits the lips, roasted malts and a coffee-like bitterness jump out. Odd for the style, but I guess Stone was trying for something unique here so I'm not going to fault them for going outside of style guidelines. This is more like a mix of a spicy Belgian and an hoppy porter. Although it tastes good, I'm not really picking up much of the chocolate/orange combo that they were going for which is somewhat disappointing. Just a lot of coffee bitterness, hops, burnt malts, and trace spices.		Mouthfeel is medium to full with a lot of soft carbonation. This was a decent beer, but truthfully it isn't much better or different than a good hoppy porter. Considering what Stone was going for here, I think they failed....but still made something decent in the process.",2009-10-06 21:31:06
5.8,283,140,Sierra Nevada Stout,American Stout,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,bump8628,4.0," Standard Sierra Nevada 12 oz bottle with bottle on date of the 120th day of 2009 (digging the new burnt sienna label).		Pours semi-thick and black with a two finger mat of tan head that really sticks to the glass.		The aroma is smokey (almost ashy) with a strong earthy hoppiness. The requisite coffee/chocolate stout notes are there but they are not as overt as they are in other stouts. 		Again, the taste is full of smokey, roasted flavor (from the use of black malt instead of roasted barley and chocolate malt) and raw, leafy, earthy hops. Notes of chocolate, toffee, and highly roasted coffee poke through in the background. There's plenty of bitterness, both from the hops and highly roasted malts, to drive this beer home.		Semi-dry finish with the generous carbonation I've come to expect from Sierra Nevada. A really nice, and often overlooked stout. This would pair excellently with some smokey BBQ or a sharp cheese.",2009-10-06 21:31:25
8.4,53143,612,Hop Huffer,American IPA,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,beertooth,4.0," On tap at the brewpub served in a nonic pint glass. Review from notes taken.		This beer is a clear orange color with with a decent two fingers of billowy white head that drops down to a thin layer that leaves some lacing. 		The nose is a bit faint, but inviting. Oily pine, grassy citrus, and sweet bready malts. 		The first sip hits me with a little grass, pine, citrus, and follows up with the malt backbone and more lingering bitter pine. It's not extremely over the top like some of the other wet hopped IPAs I've been enjoying, but it's one of the freshest tasting. There's a nice oily piney finish that builds with each sip.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation.		I was really excited to try this and I wasn't let down. I thought it was an extremely easy drinking IPA despite the abv. I knew it wasn't going to be hop monster considering the small amount of wet hops Bryan was actually able to snag. I'm looking forward to the next one!",2009-10-06 21:34:29
8.74,52077,220,A Little Sumpin' Extra! Ale,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,mtbbaboon,4.0," 22oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Interesting color for a double IPA. Kind of light compared to what I'm used to seeing...sort of dark yellowish. A careless, aggressive pour left a huge, thick creamy head, eventually settling into a small pool of suds. Some lacing on the glass but not too much. The aroma...wow, it's like a hop punch in the face and I like it. Real heavy hoppy aroma that I could smell before actually taking a whiff of it. Noticeable grapefruit citrus presence as well. The taste is a hop bomb. Lots of tasty hoppiness hits immediately, then gives way to the bitter citrus. Not a whole lot of balance here, but it's quite tasty. It's got a light mouthfeel for the style and goes down real easy. An enjoyable beer for hopheads like myself.",2009-10-06 21:34:33
5.4,87,147,Stone Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,KarlHungus,3.5," This beer pours a hazy light amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is a nice balance of malt and hops. There is some nice caramel notes with ample grapefruit, and a little pine. The taste is just as balanced as the aroma with the same profile. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice APA, but nothing spectacular. I could, however, probably session this, and thoroughly enjoy the session.",2009-10-06 21:35:33

A - Hazy golden and orange show great carbonation from the bottom with a continuous mountain of off white head. Sparkling.		S - Sweet apple and grape form a bubblegum nose with a hint of yeast spiciness.		T - Sweet and again bubblegum comes to mind... Some coriander spice, banana, apple, with a honey finish. There is a slight alcohol warmth. Biscuits and toast show more as it warms.		M - Big body and Belgian carbonation. Similar to Duvel only chewier.		D - Moderate. Great taste and clean finish, another top notch offering from North Coast.",2009-10-06 21:35:39
5.0,53159,765,Trafalgar Hop Nouveau 2009,American Pale Ale (APA),3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,mrmanning,3.5," Bottle from the LCBO- A slightly hazed gold with one finger of white froth. Leaves a bit of lace. Spicy nose contains fresh hoppy saaz? anise, clove, and floral notes, and follows with a marked malty fruitiness, but it is just really hoppy. Tastes of slightly sweet malts, but then the hops take over. Really nice bitter and fresh hops. I am surprised at how hoppy and flavourful this is. Very floral and anise like, lots of rose petal too. A bit of lemony sweetness closes the finish. Excellent stuff. Would have been great for summer. Trafalgar, keep this up, it is am impressive effort.",2009-10-06 21:35:47
4.5,53158,765,Trafalgar Malted Corpse,Irish Red Ale,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,mrmanning,3.0," Bottle from the LCBO- A very still, cola brown pour. Produces only a few bubbles at the edge of the glass. SImple nose has cola and milk chocolate, a smidge of hops. Sweet milk chocolate flavours are upfront, cola too, dark fruit makes an appearance as well. There is a nice dose of grassy bittering hops towards the end to balance out this fairly sweet beer. Thin and flat on the finish, with a bitter-sweet lingering aftertaste. A weird little beer. Not bad, but it is odd. Like a coca-cola beer. I was expecting a little more after having the excellent Hop Nouveau.",2009-10-06 21:36:46

It smacks of apple and grapes with some faint caramel notes and almost tastes more like a cider than a beer.		The appearance is omewhat in line with that and the colour is somewhat reminicent of natural cloudy apple juice.		The smell is somewhat faint but fresh like an apple orchard and as such not bad. Drinkability is OK but the drink gets a bit acidic and sour after a while so...,2009-10-06 21:40:20
7.25,9474,863,Temptation,American Wild Ale,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,ShogoKawada,5.0," A big thanks goes to augustgarage for this one. I was on pins and needles waiting for the UPS man. Since then I've been eyeing this one in my fridge for a week. Part of me wanted to open it the second it arrived, the other part of me never wanted to open it. Gave in to temptation at the advice of my roommate. Thanks, buddy. Cork did NOT want to come out of this one.. took a good minute. No matter. 		A- 750ml, poured carefully into wide snifter. I let the bottle breathe for 20 minutes or so, as my fridge is a tad cold. Pours a wonderful pale yellow, with a thin, thin head. Looks delightful, the coloration is superbly blonde. Beer looks pleasantly viscous, shape-shifting in the snifter. 		S- Intense. Is this a wine? The chardonnay barrels come through in full force. Definite funk, a earthy woodiness, and more complex fruit than I can pick out in one sniff. Prob. one of the top 3 complex bouquets of any beer I've had. 		T- For the power of the nose, this beer is remarkably subdued. Amazingly tasty, though. Tart, drying like a fine wine. A mind-bogglingly good combination of gentle sweetness, carbonation, and funk make for the holy trinity of beers. Seriously... I want a gallon of this stuff, ASAP. 		I taste a tart apple, mild lemon, and a mead-like honey sweetness. There's a tonic water quality to this one, as well, which plays wonderfully off the fruit sweetness. Not to be outdone, the woody earthiness and the Brett finish leaving you scratching your head. So many flavors that just fit perfectly. I cannot fathom the trial and error that went into producing this beer, but it was so worth it. I had high hopes for this one... and they were smashed, shattered, and decimated. 		Note- I thought this couldn't get any better. Second pour, I got all the yeast and whatnot. I was proven wrong... the funk is stronger, tastier, and fan-fuckin'-tastic.		M- Wonderful. Crisp, tart, sour, sweet, mildly acidic, and perfectly carbonated. This one dances across your tongue, begging for another sip. And another. And another. Before you know it, you're wondering where you can get some more. I'd drink this all day everyday if I was a millionaire. As it is, it was an amazing treat.		D- Through the roof. We'll see how I feel tomorrow (stories of gastro issues have made the rounds), but I would buy a boatload of this in an instant if I had the chance. A smile all the way down, one of the best... by far. I would give this perfect 5's... appearance just wasn't earth shattering. But where it counts? This beer excels. Trust me. The best-tasting beer I've ever had.		They often say don't believe the hype. I agree.... this one is far beyond words of praise. 		A *BIG* thank you to augustgarage... You made my day, week, month, and year with this one.",2009-10-06 21:40:36
5.3,103,35,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,American Pale Wheat Ale,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,Metalmonk,3.5," Healthy cap of foam, nearly two fingers thick, bubbles and crackles its way to a thinner layer, but it does so slowly. Creamy and a bit rocky, it threatens to leave lace on the glass, and then doesn't do much in that department. Color is a hazy golden yellow.		Nose is herbal in nature, and everything appears as advertised: zing of lemon; that gentle niceness of wheat malt; grains of paradise appearing as an exotic spicing that would've been tough to nail down if we weren't already told what it is. All this is quite mild, and there isn't a ton else going on, but it's enjoyable enough.		Flavor is a well-balanced blend of citrus (yep, lemon), spices, earthy/clean wheat, and a light dash of hops. A bit soapy on the finish, and also more sour and less tart at that point. A sweeter non-citrus fruit element appears with warming. 		Feels slick enough, body somewhere between light and medium, and not quite as soft as many other wheat ale. It's not harsh either, but ample carbonation nearly edges it into soda territory. 		Decent stuff, and perhaps I should have tried it when it was fresher (and when it wasn't a cold and drizzly early autumn day). Recommended, but only if you can't get your hands on Oberon, Dreamweaver or a great Belgian wit, which perform that same function with greater results.",2009-10-06 21:46:08

That s where the commonality with any Munich type beer ends. It tatstes like rocket fuel and that is not nice rocket fuel but rocket fuel mixed with machine oil only thinner.		Normally I LOVE strong beers - DIPAs, Doppelbocks, Dubbels you name it.		But this is so bad I dont even know what o say other than hands off!",2009-10-06 21:46:35
7.4,4629,26,Rabbid Rabbit,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,3.0,3.5,5.0,4.0,PerzentRizen,4.5," Poured into a snifter glass this beer has a hazy straw color. The color and head retention even mimic that of a macro lager. The look is thin and somewhat watery, but looks can be very deceiving.		The first smell has tons of spice to it. Cloves, taragon, fennel, and perhaps some annice fill the nose. There is also a faint sweetness in the nostrils. Another medicinal aroma is picked up and behind it some hops.		The flavors in this beer are so compelling. I'm surpised it isn't rated higher. Perhaps the appearance is hard to overcome. The first thing you notice as far as taste is the sweet malt, then the buttery flavors followed by raisons, oily hops on the roof of the mouth (but they do not linger), then a dryness that ends to a buttery finish (but not in a bad diacetyl way).		Mouthfeel is much more light and airy than the first whiff and taste will tell you. The alcohol help to thin out the massive flavor attach. I wouldn't call the mouthfeel thin by any means despite what the beer ""looks"" like (see above). I would call this an Imperial Saison with a perfect mouthfeel.		9.00%! Really?!%*& I wouldn't expect that from what I've just tasted. I know this beer is higher in alcohol than most saisons but 9% is just off the charts. The flavors are great, the aroma is beautiful, and the mouthfeel is a touch thick but this beer is insanely drinkable. I will have no problem finishing this bomber by myself.		My advice...seek this beer out and enjoy a few of them before the weather turns too cool. I like this one a lot and will definately seek it out again. Very good, very cool, very tasty!",2009-10-06 21:46:38

Smells of oranges, buttery popcorn, like a sweet lager.		Very interesting taste, citrusy, a weird buttery taste that is actually quite good, some grassiness and a nice light hop finish, more sweet than hoppy.

10.8,53175,11031,Heil & Zegen,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.0,2.5,3.0,xpimptastikx,3.0," Brought a bottle back that I picked up at the Alvinne bottle shop in Belgium. Hopped with Amarillo and Czech Saaz. It was bottled on February 2nd, 2009.	Bottle # 311		A - Pours pretty dark stream with hardly a single bubble of carbonation. EBC - 123		S - The hops have definitely faded but there is still a hint of the citrus bite behind what is a large carmel malt smell.		T - This is hopefully just a fraction of what this beer was fresh. Almost all hops are gone, just leaving a light bittering. The malt bill has turned this into a barleywine. This reminds me of a 1yr old flat SN Bigfoot. 		M/D - This is one of the flatest beers I've had in a long time (I've never had a flat lost abbey, yet). The lack of carbonation makes me wish they called this a barleywine, because then it would be someone acceptable. Still, it was a task to try and finish this beer.",2009-10-06 21:47:43
5.7,7327,1880,Dark Side Vanilla Porter,American Porter,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,beertooth,3.5," Thanks to Ben(madorb) for sharing this with me on the train ride down to Flossmoor last weekend. Review is from notes taken.		A cola brown liquid with a thin layer of white head that drops fast and forms a collar.		The nose is interesting and what you'd expect from a vanilla porter. Dark malts, coffee, sweet, but not cloying vanilla. There's isn't much else going on.		The first sip gives me some sugary vanilla up front followed by a mild coffe flavor and finishes with some more bitter burnt malts. It is enjoyable, but would fare better with a heavier malt bill.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated.		I'm glad I was able to try this, although it reminded me more of a brown ale with coffee creamer in it. It's worth a try if you come across it.",2009-10-06 21:48:27
8.0,22982,9351,Jihlavsky Grand,Euro Strong Lager,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,mrmanning,3.0," Bottle courtesy of Milos- As the descriptor says, it is honey gold. Deep honey. Nose is full of honey too. Lots of malts and sugars, orange peel, a bit alcoholic. Tastes sweet but not balanced. Syrupy malts and citrus peel essence meet candied malts and browns sugars are overwhelming at times. Slick, syrupy finish is sweet and lengthy. Thanks Milos!",2009-10-06 21:49:32

Intense nose of candi sugar and fresh hops, citric, with anise and other floral spices. Sweet malts and fruit dominate the flavours, but are met with lots of bittering hops, anise, rose petal, mango towards the end. Warming and bitter finish. Certainly a sipper.

Nice mocha cap sits atop. Nose is quite fruity with plum and prune, candi malts, earthy and rustic with tobacco and spices, yeasty and funky. Flavour profile is surprisingly sweet, with good fruit and roasty coffee, almost leathery, with tobacco flavours, floral hops with anise in the finish. As with a lot of beer from this brewer, the ABV is nowhere to be detected. Very good offering.",2009-10-06 21:52:42
8.6,27463,159,Tickle Brain,Dubbel,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,DerBayer,3.5, According to BA this is in the style of a Dubbel and i can kind of see it but think Dubbel blended with a Lambic. It does show strong sour grape and apple notes with strong malt characteristics and some faint grassy hops. Not bad in all and the colour of cola orange is kind of cool.		The mouhfeel is quite refreshing and you dont taste the alcohol so kudos for that. Drinkability is pretty high overall,2009-10-06 21:52:55

The nose is roasted malt with a hint of molasses, thankfully without coffee.		This is well carbonated and briefly rather too sweet (unfortunately reminding me of artificial sweeteners) before a much needed bitterness takes over lifting the brew to a higher plane.",2009-10-06 21:54:16

The head is a beautiful burnt caramel, which lazily clings to the glass.		Smell: Dark roasted coffee beans, crumbled baker's chocolate, and molasses.		Taste: Bitter, roasted coffee beans and baker's chocolate. Almost exactly mirrors the aroma. It's such a perfect and bold mixture of the coffee, bitter chocolate, and molasses flavors, with a touch of hops twang to keep it from dredging too far--balanced with a heavy emphasis on roastiness.",2009-10-06 21:57:18

I like the complex malt profile with lots of fruity and mild bitter notes.		The brew is syroupy but not cloying and surprisingly refreshing on the palate.

The nose is pure hops, tropical fruit and pine with a touch of malt. The hoppy taste is good, bitter and well complemented by malt sweetness but make no mistake this beer is hop forward. Hop oily and medium bodied with bright carbonation. Finishes bitter and kind of salty but in a really good way if that makes sense. I thought that at the insane 102 I.B.U.'s this brew would have a more harsh bitterness than it does. This stuff is great, I wish I had another one.",2009-10-06 21:59:15

Nice herbal and spicy flavor with a nice mild hop bitterness. 		WOW - I thought I had already reviewed this and got the Tripel in a beer of the month set. I was wrong! When I checked I had only reviewed the White and the Double Ale. I did have this once, at an ""Allagash diner/tasting"" at the Flying Saucer in Columbia, but it was before I joined this site.

Pours a very nice slight hazey golden yellow/orange color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind.

6.5,20478,1199,Founders Harvest Ale,American IPA,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,bsp77,5.0," Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint.		Appearance: Mostly clear light orange-yellow with moderate white head which leaves nice lacing lines. Much lighter beer than I expected.		Smell: Exceedingly strong grapefruit smell, with some other citrus notes (and perhaps pine) buried beneath. The smell is quite simply hops personified, and is by far the freshest beer I have ever smelled.		Taste: Exceedingly citrusy with grapefruit, orange and lemon all present. Slightly sweet toasted malts are attempting to come forward and only halfway succeeding. The bitterness is persistent and remains long after each sip. While fantastic, almost too much grapefruit for me; needs a titch more balance. What am I saying, screw balance.		Feel: Moderate carbonation, relatively light body but somewhat oily from the hops, mouth suckingly dry.		Drinkability: Despite the bitterness, the fantastic juicy hop profile and dryness will not let me stop drinking. It also helps that I smell such fantastic hops every time I lift the glass.		Who the hell listed this as an APA? 6.5% and 70 IBUs, that is not an APA. More of an IPA, but I actually think there should be a Fresh Hop/Wet Hop category.",2009-10-06 22:00:26

Smell - Smells of bitter hops, some pine, grapefruit, then the sweetness/maltiness comes through. Very pleasant. Not overly floral - a nice balance.		Taste - Tastes similar to how it smells. Begins with a smack of hoppy bitterness which lends itself to a nice grapefruit peel that then ends with a thicker, malty taste. Honestly, I was expecting it to be bitter the whole way through but it had a nice malt back to it (maybe this sat on the shelf for a while and mellowed a bit? I keep hearing about how the hops destroy your mouth and I did not get that feeling).		Mouthfeel - Light to moderate thickness. Not overly carbonated but just enough 		Drinkability - This was the first drink of the night and it was a bit tough to finish it but only because I was so incredibly full from eating fondue. Overall I was impressed and look forward to getting some fresher bottles soon.",2009-10-06 22:02:32

The aroma is very nice with sweet malts that move to caramel and then some restrained resiny pine hops. The taste is smooth with malt sweetness bleeding into caramel notes and increasing pine hops. This is good stuff. I get lots of sweetness that plows more and more into modest pine hop bitterness. It ends with mild pine hanging on into the after taste. This is certainly not one of those BW that seems more like an IIPA. The hops are there but not there, there(?).",2009-10-06 22:07:20

The aroma has notes of crystal malts, caramelization, some pine hops and hints of dark fruity esters. The taste has an initial pulse of pine and citrus hops that run the flavor from front to back. By midway thick malts and notes hinting at but not reaching dark fruitiness surface and move the experience toward the finish. The hops still over shadow the other flavor components. It seems very IIPA - ish. Very nice American Barleywine.",2009-10-06 22:08:53
8.0,51627,3521,L'Ange TombÃ©,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,IBUnit63,3.5," Not a huge pop of the synthetic cork at all. Into a Duvel tulip...		It's actually a bourbon barleywine color. The head is a light maple color. Carbonation is rather active and of medium speed. Decent enough.		There's a little bit of spice in here that emerges from the darker malts. Decent hop pine goes well. Slight apple note may indicate flaw but it works well.		Methinks the carbonation is a little light here. Not in volume...in taste. There's a diluted club soda feel to this - a little salty. It may need more warmth but the taste profile is light. The malts indicate a Germanic presence here; hops are rather light. It's sort of a mix between a Saison and a Marzen. I need that Belgian yeast electricity, though...and it's a little light in that department.		It rolls well on the palate. Nice, light feel that's quite spritely while emitting those Germanic spice notes. Finish is crisp and clean...no caffeine.		It's easy enough to drink...but I'm really expecting a little more flavor here. It's tough to see where the alcohol comes from because this doesn't feel strong at all. In fact, it's borderline quenching. It'll play in a pinch.",2009-10-06 22:09:35
9.6,2912,812,Old Dipsea Barleywine Style Ale,American Barleywine,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,BigMcLargeHuge,3.5," Bomber pours a nice amber hue with decent enough tan head that can throw up some spotty lacing from time to time. The aroma is full of figs, dates, prunes and cherries. It seems a bit bold and a bit too bright. The taste begins slick and sweet with malts and then quickly moving to fairly bold/bright notes of figs and cherries. Toward midway it picks up some raisins and another mild wave of smooth maltiness to go along with some sort of candi sugar that gives it just a bit of a beet sensation. The sweet malts attempt to pull the flavor together but they doesn't really make it. I think a year or couple of years of age will even this out and create a pleasing blended complex flavor.",2009-10-06 22:10:22

Light hay color, white head with fairly good retention for a lager. There's even a few drifts of lace! Still pretty pale and ugly. For what it's worth the bottle art is weak too.

The aroma is mild with hints of dark fruitiness and generally sweet notes and not much else. Very sweet flavor that is nearly punishing in its palate assault. I get cherries, sugar coated plums and harsh un-ripe raisins. By midway pine hops rise up and help tame the overly sweet notes to get it to a semblance of balance.

A-Pours a clear straw yellow with a one finger off white head that breaks apart very fast. It looks like an American lager. Lots of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom and make a nice crackling noise as they hit the surface.		S-The corriander spice used is very upfront. I get a tad bit of wheat and some orange in there. It reminds me in a lot of ways of chamomile tea.		T-The spices jump out very quickly, especially the corriander. In the middle and end I pick up on a lot of orange peel flavor. It is fairly sweet tasting, something not really present in the nose. I get a little bit of wheat in the back of my mouth. The aftertaste is of sweet lemon and orange.		M-Lighter bodied and extremely crisp from the active carbonatio.		D-It is a light, easy drinking beer that is perfect for a hot and muggy day. I found it to be overly spiced, but it would be a good gateway beer.		This was my first offering from this brewery.

Pours clear amber with gold edges and thin off white head. The aroma is mild with hints of molasses, dark fruitiness and a background of malts. The taste is rich and delicious with a pulse of both deep dried dark fruitiness and sweet smooth molasses. It remains that way into the finish allowing for independent cherry, plum and sugar stewed raisins to be identified. It approaches being peppery but never actually gets there.

The aroma is a mix of figs, prunes and dates to go along with aged chewy malts and faint wood. Good nose yet a bit modest in strength. Very nice taste that will yield increased goodness with more age. I get musty dusty dates, yams, figs and prunes. Before midway the barrel notes rise up with bourbon, vanilla and oak adding to the complexity. Well balanced flavors that demand additional quaffings.

The aroma has a mild mix of pine hops and dark fruitiness to go along with milder notes of malts and alcohol chemical heat. The taste is bold and nearly harsh with pine hop resiny bitterness moving into modest levels of dark fruity esters.

Yam beer, here we go. This one pours an awesome orange/brown hue that screams the season, a small tan head rests atop. Lots of sweetness and gentle breezes of alcohol in the nose, sweet potato malt? This beer is difficult to review because there is so much happening here. Thanksgiving in a bottle really, the light maple syrup note works well with the sweetness and mild spiciness of the brew, the alcohol content is detectable but it cuts right through the flavor in a way that enhances the experience rather than hurt it, this beer is hot in a good way.

Pours slightly hazy deep gold with thin off white head. It has a pleasing aroma of dark fruity esters and toffee/butterscotch that works well here. I also get mild roasted malts too. The taste is much the same with a pulse of dark fruity esters followed by toffee and butterscotch that quickly becomes too much by midway. It becomes smooth and dry into the finish.

Lots of lacing in tiny spotted sheetings and some threads.		Aroma is a wonderful display of dryish hoppyness thats grassy, smurfing in on some herbal qualities and floral notes. Perfect background of dry caramel malt and cereal grains.		Flavors are just as nice and quite lengthy with lots of balancing fun flavors! Super finely crafted with great aspects to dryish hoppyness that splits between floral grassyness and herbal bitterness with a touch of oily resin and toasted orangey fruityness. Great backbone of dry caramel malt, some sweet burnt butter and toasty edgings to its rounded finish as it has a complexing hoppy finish of dry grassy, herbal, bittering spice, and uniquely grained toasty parts. Nice!		Body is easily medium with a simple alluring carbonation that sits back enough to let in an easy softness within its drier tones and bittering hoppy elements.		So glad to see a well-balanced Amber like this dawn the shelves here in MN, and by Magic Hat no less? Hope it sticks around as this will be consumed quickly upon purchase.",2009-10-06 22:16:29

A - Pours black with a small creamy tan head.		S - Aroma is coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and roast. Smells great.		T - Flavor is incredible with fresh, creamy, chocolatey mocha, vanilla, and some caramel and roasted malt. Great balance. This is pretty much to imperial porters what Sculpin is to IPAs, i.e. it's awesome. Ballast Point is becoming one of my favorites.		M - Medium-full body with a smooth palate, somewhat low carbonation, and only mild coffee astringency.		D - Very high for an imperial porter at 10% ABV.

The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Large amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. The aroma and flavor sadly does not carry the show. Mild vanilla and chocolate aromas but very mild. The flavor is a bit off. Touches of vanilla and coffee but it lacks a nice malt base to help with the non traditional flavors. Slight bitterness with no lingering aftertaste. The body starts nice but falls off in the end and feels a little thin and overcarbonated. Nothing bad with this beer but it comes off rather timid and poorly executed.

S - Hops: Grapefruit, fresh cut wet grass; pine, and barnyard wet straw. Maybe a touch of Earthiness.		T - Hoptacular. Assaults the tongue; hops, followed by more hops, and then to finish it off, some more bittering hops accented by some other sort of hop. Some malt on the back end and finishes with dry hops. There's a hop fight going on in my mouth and I'm calling the cops. The Hop Cops -- beaten to a hop pulp -- are sprinkled with fresh, wet hops. Other than all that, it's quite balanced.		M - Too numb to detect anything.		D - Have you lost your mind? 100+ IBU. 9% ABV. This ale is out of control. Recommended.",2009-10-06 22:22:06

Typical AIPA flavors, not as strong as some beers I've had in the past of this style.		M. Medium. Medium/light for an IPA.		D. Relatively smooth, probably on the stronger side for a session beer, but goes down really well and could probably enjoy a six pack in a night of this. 		I may be somewhat starting to get burned out on this beer as I've been drinking lots of it as we stocked up on six packs at my house, but its my favorite of O'Fallon so far and an overall solid AIPA.",2009-10-06 22:22:14

Pours clear deep copper with gold edges and thin off white head. The aroma has mostly pine hops, some grassy notes and then moving toward wood and booze. It seems to be barrel aged but I'm unsure as to the type of formal barrel contents. The taste begins with sweet dark fruity esters then moving into booze and muted wood notes.

A: Cloudy reddish/brown color with a nice thick off-white head and moderate lacing.		S: Slightly sweet malt scent. Nice scent to start off. Not too overpowering and slight caramel roasty aroma with mild hop overtones.		T&M: Smooth light to medium bodied brown ale. Much smoother than your standards. Real nice balance between malts and hops. Hits hard up front and fades to a nice mildly sweet malty/smoked/roasty taste. Finish is dry.

Lots going on. Cherry again, brown sugar, vanilla, lots of fruity esters. Warming effect of alcohol at the end. There is a wonderful depth to the flavors that makes this just one to enjoy over time. The beer keeps opening up and you get more of a sense of the wood aging.		Smooth and silky. Almost no carbonation. At the risk of getting myself in trouble this reminds me of Angel Share...

This is the second beer I've had at this event that has simply floored me with its silky rich yummy goodness. Pours deep amber to near dark brown and micro thin tan head. Wow! Another knee buckler aroma with a smooth blended mixture of wood, molasses, rich dark fruity esters and more rich molasses. The wood notes become mildly brighter upon further inspection. The taste is just amazing with some smooth bourbon flowing into deep rich dark fruity esters accented with well rounded smooth wood notes. Just a smooth beer that gets almost velvety for a while.

A - Bright red in color with a small pinkish head.		S - Aroma is blackberries and raspberries, a little like a fruit candy, sweet and only mildly sour,		T - Flavor is not too exciting, a little funky with blackberries and other berries, red grapes, sugar, and a little tartness.

The smell was surprisingly hoppy for an American Wheat, but there were also floral, herbal, citrus, and biscuit hints. The hoppiness was much better blended in the flavor with more herbs coming to the fore, and a nice biscuit finish. Citrus hints were very, very subtle in the flavor. Medium-bodied, not heavily carbonated (if at all), and silky on the palate. Very sessionable. A very good example of the genre, but was expecting a little more fruitiness from an American Wheat, like some other fine examples such as Flying Fish Exit 11. That being said though, this is a very well done wheat ale.",2009-10-06 22:25:31

The appearance is classic, clear copper with ample fluffy white head. The aroma is not very intense but has a nicely rounded sweetness. The taste is very well rounded. Nice nutty cereal malt and enough hops to finish clean. The mouthfeel is fairly light and clean. This is an amazingly drinkable beer, in my opinion world class for the style, Oktoberfest beer is meant to be drank from 1 liter steins, and this is one I could down all night.

A-Pours a dark brown with some visible reddish hue. Has a half finger tan head that dissolves quickly to a tiny ring surrounding some film.		S-It smells of sweet malt and a touch of roast malt. It does smell nutty, but I can't say it is pecans specifically.		T-It tastes of sweet malt, but not over the top caramel/toffee flavor. It is definitely nutty tasting and it has some bitterness. I get some citrus hop flavor in the beer. Every few sips I pick up on some maple syrup flavor. It is a tad bit roasty in between sips.		M-It falls on the low end of the medium spectrum. It is quite smooth and has a comfortable level of carbonation.		D-Easy drinking beer that I enjoyed.		I thought this was one of the better versions of a style that I typically avoid.

5.3,103,35,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,American Pale Wheat Ale,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,Dave412,2.5," From notes		Pale orange color small head quickly gone. Cloudy slightly.		Smell of wheat or wet straw but with zesty scents. Smell of something damp.		Lemon citrus orange tastes but nothing strong, mild tastes nothing really stands out, some grain and fruit on finish.		Medium body, seems to linger some in the mouth. 		I find myself not craving a second one after drinking one. Dont know what it is, not really overly filling but just doesnt settle well with me. The taste just doesnt leave me wanting more.		Certainly not my favorite wheat ale, probably worse one I've tried although I honestly havent had tons of this type.",2009-10-06 22:32:56
6.4,22189,10607,Bengali Tiger,American IPA,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,donniecuffs,4.5," Poured a nice hazy amber/orange color, with a thin white head, that did lace fairly well. The aroma was a veritable bouquet of pink grapefruit, apricot, floral hops, breadiness, and maltiness. Needless to say, I was excited to take a sip. The taste validated the aroma...a near-perfect blend of citrus and floral hops that dissolved to a biscuity/slightly yeasty finish. Medium-bodied, lightly carbonated, and very sessionable. I think I downed three pints in an hour. Very well done.",2009-10-06 22:34:35
7.0,52529,12959,Smoke From The Oak (Apple Brandy Barrel Aged),American Porter,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,ATPete,3.0," capped 750ml		purchased on release day, thanks man!		My god this beer has a striking resemblance to cola, except for the big brown head that forms and stays atop the rich colored brew. Lots of smoke, some wood, nothing really screams apple brandy yet but we'll see. Super smokey, toasty, burnt and slightly tart porter. It doesnt taste much like the other SFTO brews, the base beer at least. Roasty, burnt chocolate malt dominant, ashy with an odd bitterness late palate, the apple brandy makes an appearance on the finish and briefly into the aftertaste, i do like how that flavor comes across, im just not thrilled with the overall execution. It tastes to me like this brew was intentionally barrel aged to hide a couple flaws, just my opinion.",2009-10-06 22:35:57
5.5,42186,596,Portsmouth Le Chat Noir,Irish Dry Stout,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.5,ckeegan04,3.5," A - Dark mahogany verging on black. Inpenetrable even when held up to light. Thick, creamy espresso like brown head. Head is initially about one finger after a somewhat agressive pour but it quickly fades to a thin foam cap.		S - Roasted malt, hints of coffee and a faint floral hoppiness. The roastiness is certainly the dominant aroma in this one.		T - Surprisingly strong fruity hoppiness backed by light roasted malt. The hops are primarily citrus and they carry through the entire drink. Somewhat odd.		M/D - Medium bodied with a velvety feel. Good carbonation as well. Easy drinking but the strong fruitiness is a little odd to me.",2009-10-06 22:36:10

S - Sweet pale malt, candi sugar, light fruits, and citrusy hops.		T - Flavor is excellent: sweet pale malt, apple, pear, mango, a hint of funky yeast, and just the right amount of citrusy hops to make it interesting but not too hop-forward.		M - Palate is smooth and medium-light with the 10% ABV almost unnoticeable.		D - Very drinkable. Another winner from CL. This is one of the better American tripels out there.",2009-10-06 22:36:35

Indian.		Tasted a week ago at a Northern India/Pakistan restaurant. It replaced Taj Mahal, which I was not impressed with. Pairs better with the food. Ideal, similar to Dos Equis and Tex-Mex.		Drinkable alone, but if that's the case you can do better. But if you're having a curry, then your meal will benefit from this beer.",2009-10-06 22:36:39

Pours striking clear copper to rose with amber core and thin tan head. The aroma is full of sweet rich dark fruity esters of prunes, plums, some cherry and a little bit of raisin to go along with pine hops in the background. I also get an understandable bit of heat on the nose with a longer draw. But hey, it's a big beer. The taste is much the same as the aroma, fantastic for the style, with deep rich dark fruitiness with wrinkled prunes, figs and ripe plums with a bit of cherry. Just deep richness that makes me want to sip it all night. For a bit of balance a light amount of pine hop bitterness is rolling around in the background. I love this stuff.",2009-10-06 22:37:10

The aroma is very hoppy and it pretty much tastes how it smells. As you'd expect from an APA, it is distinctly hoppy with a bit of citrus. It is also one of the more drinkable APA's that I've had and I had no problem drinking each one to the bottom. I would definitely recommend and will probably pick it up again.",2009-10-06 22:37:57

Taste: Prickly carbonation leads into some dark fruit like cherries and plums, then there is a transition to peach and apricot followed with a semi-dry finish.

Great color pours a darker golden haze, with smooth clinging lacing. Smells: citrus, pounds of hops, with a hint of banana and clove. Tastes: Hops hit the tongue with pleasantly brute force and mold with a hint of the citrus in the smell. Hops control the ride, very great brew. Let them burn and linger, minutes after the first sip the hop burn is still there but the clove and hints of tropical fruit coat the tongue. A very good DIPA. Not the best I've had, but solid!!

A-It is very light in color for an IPA. Pours a clear golden yellow with some orange highlights. It has a one finger off white head that has some nice retention. It leaves some good lacing.		S-I get some grapefruit, grassy hops, and caramel malt. There is also some lemon in there. It definitely is maltier than I like for an IPA and doesn't scream of lots of hops.		T-It tastes a lot like it smells. The malt is pronounced throughout. I find it to taste more of grassy hops than citrus hops. There is some grapefruit bitterness that comes through at the end. It has a somewhat grainy finish.		M-Thinner bodied with good carbonation.		D-It is not a heavy beer and is good for those that want more malt than hops.		The last time I had this beer was over 8 years ago and I remember it tasting better. Not sure if that is because my palate has changed or because it was a better recipe. I probably would pass on this the next time",2009-10-06 22:45:56

A two finger dark tan head sits patiently with a crop of bubbles in the middle. Later than sooner it starts to slowly melt away. A thick, unbroken lacing is left behind. Smell is complex with caramel malts, eathy hops, black licorice, stale coffee and burnt wood which all blend to near perfection. Tastes of more caramel malts with a good addition of hops right behind for more near perfection in the balance department. Goes down smooth and creamy with a slight crispness at the end. A medium to full bodied sleeper brew here. I had no idea. Awesome.",2009-10-06 22:49:35

Really tight and creamy finger and a half of off white head. Some larger particles also seen floating around. Smells delightful...reminiscent of a DIPA. Also get a good deal of caramel and some spicy dark fruits. Definitely sweet with caramel...really strong on the malt. Alcohol is pretty noticeable. I'm not real experienced with barley wines, as this is only the second I've sampled. I thought the smell was better than the taste on this one. Seems this is hop heavy for the style from what I've read, which is in my favor. It's a good beer, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have another...at this time anyway. As my opinion goes, it's beautiful to look at, smells great, but the taste just doesn't fit my palate like I'd hoped.",2009-10-06 22:50:10

No bottling info is given.		A-Pours pitch black with a 3/4 finger sandy head that is active and bubbly for a decent amount of time. The head eventually rests at a nice filmy layer.		S-Dark roasted malt dominates the nose. There is also a fair amount of sweet chocolate that is present. It smells of good, freshly roasted coffee. I find a lot of coffee beers to smell more like a pitcher of coffee that has been left sitting out for hours. As it warms I get some molasses and vanilla.		T-There is some definite bitterness from the coffee and roasted malts. The coffee flavor is a lot more subtle than I expected from the nose. The sweet chocolate is very prevalent on the finish. It has a good coffee aftertaste. Caramel and vanilla flavors come and go throughout the session. All of the flavors come together very nicely im this beer.		M-Thinner bodied for such a high abv stout. It is creamy and smooth with a good level of carbonation.		D-A very good sipper that is best enjoyed as a nightcap.

The pour is dark brown with an explosve foamy, frothy tan head that seems to take forever to simmer down. The aroma comes off with a mix of roasted chocoalte malts and some mild hops in the background. The mouthfeel is sharp but medium with a lot of carbonation on the tongue. The taste has a roasted, chocolate malts and mild hops combo with a little bit of sugar to sweeten the punch. But with all the sweetness at the start there is a kind of sour finish.

Not much in the ay of lacing.		Earthy oak aroma with hints of vanilla, citrus hops and caramel malt all complemented by a strong bourbon alcohol presence.		The concept of bourbon barrel aging an IPA is interesting. On one hand it seems very appealing to blend these two flavors but on the other the bourbon could be too prominent, overtaking the flavor of the hops. Fortunately this beer falls into the latter category. This beer still contains a very bitter hop forward flavor with a decent amount of citrus peel and grapefruit as well as some dry piny notes. This is balanced by a sweet bourbon alcohol warmth with some earthy oak and subtle vanilla flavor.",2009-10-06 22:58:39

Semi sweet aroma with lots of roasted nuttiness, and a hint of butter.		Taste/Mouthfeel - Tasted of big roasted/smokey malts, not really sweet at all, following is some very subtle dark chocolate notes, and nutty flavors. Rich smokey/roasted flavors linger pretty well, and as it warms, more burnt like flavors with mild biscuit are pronounced which only made it richer! Mouthfeel had some apparent crispness as it hit the tongue, then very creamy & smooth, which complimented the flavors very well! Around medium-full bodied.		Drinkability/Final thoughts - I really enjoyed this beer, from the fresh from the tap appearance, to the way the creamy mouthfeel complimented the rich smokey flavors. I could enjoy 2, maybe 3 before it became a little to rich, but otherwise extremely drinkable on a cold night. I highly recommend it. Cheers!i",2009-10-06 23:14:58
6.0,26501,8325,Fisherman's IPA,American IPA,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,NHGrafx,4.0," Poured from a 12oz brown bottle.		Pours a nice copper color, small head which doesn't last long, but leaves nice lacing.		This has a nice aroma to it. Floral, fruity, and sweet. I smell something similar to raisins. Some malt aromas also. Good hop aroma.		The taste has a nice bitterness up front, some light sweetness, there is a taste that is like black grapes. Some bready/malty flavors . Nice hoppy bitterness on the finish. The bitterness lingers a bit. Overall pretty good. 		This one seems pretty good all around. Trying the local stuff around the Boston Metro area I couldn't get/find when I lived in Charlotte.",2009-10-06 23:18:18
11.5,48715,689,Bare Tree Weiss Wine Vintage 2008,Wheatwine,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,alcstradamus,3.0," This is my first wheatwine, so this should be interesting.		Pours a clear copper color with a finger of head. Luckily, there are no cork bits floating around considering the epic struggle I just had that left my hand numb and a the cork laying decimated in a pile of rubble.		Smell is strong citrus, yeast, and clove. Like a fine Hefeweizen only with a bit more alcohol burn and overall potency.		The taste is very malty with more caramel characteristics than I would have anticipated, but still plenty of that wheat/yeast flavor to make it stand out. There is a bit of an unfortunate metallic presence, but luckily it is rather small. This is quite odd and perplexing, I'm not really sure whether I like it or not to be quite honest. One side of my brain is saying ""yum"" and the other is saying ""ehhh""		A big grassiness eventually comes into play and that is making me now lean towards the ""ehhh."" Mouthfeel is just fine, but overall I guess I'm just not too crazy about this. Not really complex and tasty enough to justify the high ABV. Still, worth checking out if you have the chance.",2009-10-06 23:18:53
4.2,41821,29,Bud Light Lime,Light Lager,3.0,2.5,4.0,3.5,FatSean,3.0," I broke down and bought a 22oz of this beer, just so I could try it. Poured into a 20oz tulip pint		Appears as any other light lager...pale golden-yellow		Smells of limes and maybe some grains.		Tastes like lime and malt. 		Decent carbonation, not unpleasant.		Drinkable? It's a light lager.",2009-10-06 23:20:09
,6712,2854,Flensburger Weizen,Hefeweizen,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,drpimento,3.0," Hmmm, kind of an interesting weizen. Got this bottle at Surdyk's in Minneapolis a few weeks ago. Poured with a big, foamy, light tan head and no lace. Color is a hazy (once the complete contents are poured if the bottle hasn't been aggitated before pouring) medium amber. Aroma is sort of typical Bavarian weizen: bananas and wheat with pungency and minerals. Flavor's about the same. Slightly tart, little sweetness, a little bitter. Decent body, typical weizen carbonation. Not bad. Not great. Not labeled as a ""hefe"" but did seem to have some yeast trub. Would have again, could be session.",2009-10-06 23:23:06
9.0,49891,392,Unfiltered Double Simcoe IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,bonkers,4.0," I poured from a 25 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a hazy orange with a rocky white head. There is a thick pine aroma with a hint of sweetness. The flavor is heavy with pine and a bit of citrus. The beer has a sticky mouthfeel and is a bit of a sipper. I think I prefer the original, but this is a very good DIPA.",2009-10-06 23:24:16
5.0,29976,161,Key West Golden Lager,American Adjunct Lager,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,BeachRez,3.5," Received from beer of month club.		A- Pours s golden yellow, with minimal head. Looks like an average lager.		S- Has a slight hop aroma, better than any macro.		T- A clean lager taste. Very crisp - not to bitter not too sweet. 		M/D- Easy drinking, good for warm days. Actually tasted pretty good as it warmed up. Won't go out of my way for it, but would drink it if in the Florida heat.",2009-10-06 23:24:58
7.5,51384,1805,American-Belgo Style IPA,Belgian IPA,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,AndyAvalanche,4.5," This beer will help me explore Rock Art a bit more. I've tried a handful of their brews in the past and really haven't been a fan until now. This beer has changed that. Poured a thick lightish brown that looks similar to a good apple cider type color. Very hazy, no clarity at all with a white head, with very good lacing. The smell is good, but just smells like a regular IPA, a slight hint of Belgian yeast at the end. The taste is what caught me off gaurd the most, it's very good. I didn't know it was ""American-Belgo"" style IPA, I thought it was just a Belgian IPA. Let me tell you the name explains it all. It tastes like they use American Hops with Belgian yeast/malts. It tastes as if they use both citrus and pine hops which follows the initial taste of the malt. The malts arn't too strong. The mouthfeel and drinkablility are good, well above average. This was a very unique beer I'm glad I tried it, by far the best Belgian IPA I've had.",2009-10-06 23:28:16
5.1,2296,751,Moose Drool Brown Ale,American Brown Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Viggo,4.0," 12 oz bottle, thanks to ritzkiss for the hookup.		Pours a clear dark ruby red, almost looks a bit purplish in the light, very thick tan head forms, slowly fizzes down to a medium ring around the glass, a couple streaks of lace stick. Smell is nice, very sweet and malty, caramel, quite nutty, some raisin, dark fruit, light chocolate, almond pits, almost a bit port like but that could be the age, smells nice. Taste is nice, dry and biscuity, caramel malts, nuts, raisin, dark fruit, a little bit toasty, a touch of chocolate milk, touch of roast right in the finish, quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Not up there with the big boys but I would certainly drink this if regularly available. Thanks Eric!",2009-10-06 23:30:48
7.0,29619,199,Sculpin India Pale Ale,American IPA,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,bmanning,4.0," Pours golden orange with a 2 finger beige head.	Massive tropical fruit aroma with pineapple in the lead followed by mango, passion fruit, guava, apple, and lemon. This is a fresh bottle as the hop profile is very pronounced with a nice tropical fruit complexity along with grapefruit, orange, and lemon. Overall an excellent IPA and one of my favorites.",2009-10-06 23:33:34
5.7,11485,703,Erdinger Oktoberfest Weissbier,Hefeweizen,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,Jwale73,3.5," 11.2oz. bottle served in a .5l weizen glass. 02-2010 indicated on the back label. Poured a hazy honey gold with a a dense, bright white head that filled half the glass. Head eventually settled into a solid two inch, frothy cap with light strands of lacing adhering to the sides of the glass as the brew receded. Nose reveals wheat, some clove and light banana esters with a heavy metallic quality at the back. Taste follows nose; however, somewhat muted and luckily missing the coppery quality indicated in the nose. Mouthfeel was light bodied and lively with a fairly clean finish. Decent Hefe (although I thought I was buying an Oktoberfest from the label), solid and easy drinking.",2009-10-06 23:33:57
5.9,311,10097,Harpoon IPA,American IPA,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,feelmefoam,3.5," Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a shaped pint. 		When first poured, the beer is a clear light amber color with a head that dissipated after a minute, but left good lacing down the glass. 		The beer smells a bit malty for an IPA, it also has some floral hop character present in the nose.		Some floral or herbal hops up front with a sweet caramel malt that quickly takes away any bitterness that might be present in the beer. Leaves just the slightest amount of citrusy bitterness sitting on your tongue as you swallow.		The mouthfeel is light, with a crisp finish and a moderate amount of carbonation. This isn't a bad beer, definitely refreshing, but there's much better out there. Nothing to specifically search for, imo.",2009-10-06 23:35:00

7.0,29127,26,Broo Doo,American IPA,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,MasterSki,4.0," Re-visiting Broodoo, as my first experience with it was a two-month old bottle. 2009 bottle purchased at the brewpub, and served in my Surly pint glass.		A - Like Dreadnaught, this year's iteration seems to be filtered in contrast to the murkiness of last year. Nice golden orange color with a few bubbles lazily rising to the top. Poured with two fingers of creamy foam that dissipated to a solid cap with some big bubbles. Lots of glass-coating lace. Much improved from '08.		S - This is definitely fresher than the bottle I had last year. Lots of pine in the nose, with a nice backing of tropical fruits, light floral notes, and sugary and doughy malts. Even better than I remembered!		T - Significantly more bitter than I expected from the lush, fruity, smell. After the initial wave it then dissipates into a doughy malt flavor accompanied by light floral and grapefruit notes. The residual bitterness is medium, but dissipates fairly quickly.		M - Typical Three Floyds creaminess. Very smooth medium body, with a light tingle of carbonation. There's a little bit of stickyness that also lingers.		D - At 5.5% this one is easy to put away. Low ABV, low-to-moderate carbonation, mild bitterness. Pretty much perfect for sessions.		Much better than Hop Huffer and SN Harvest, and right up there with Founders.",2009-10-06 23:36:26
7.0,52535,2372,Terrapin Midnight Project Depth Charge Espresso Milk Stout,Milk / Sweet Stout,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,mrandypandy,4.5," 22oz bottle purchased from Hop City in Atlanta, GA.		A- Pours jet-black with a thick mocha head. The head dies down a bit but keeps a small ring around the edge with decent lacing on my glass. Beautiful beer.	S- Powerful arome of fresh ground coffee beans. Lots of delicious fresh ground coffee beans. Not much else, but hey, it's a Coffee Stout.	T- More of the fresh ground coffee in the taste, with a nice hit of sweetness to balance it out. A bit of roast in the finish, but the coffee and lactose definately dominate.	M- Smooth, silky. Not as viscous as I was expecting, but I enjoyed the lighter body. A little bit of prickly carbonation on the tongue adds another layer of depth.	D- All night (or morning) long. Was able to finish the bomber and will be going back to pick up some more bottles.		Overall - I don't drink coffee. Haven't for years. It's not that I don't like coffee, just don't have the need for a cup in the mornings. If actual coffee tasted this good, I would start up in a heartbeat. This beer was well-done all around, and I'll venture to say I like it better than Terrapin's regular ""Wake-n-Bake"". Lets hope for more Terrapin/Left Hand collaborations like this one.",2009-10-06 23:37:54
10.43,38094,863,Toronado 20th Anniversary Ale,American Wild Ale,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,brewandbbq,4.5," 750ml bottle from the cellar.		Pours clear amber with a copper hue. A two inch head of dense beige settled slowly revealing a quarter inch surface coating and loads of sheeted lacework. A real beaut throughout the glass.		Aromatics lead off with plenty of pungent funk, tannic fruit, and oaky earthiness.	Dried cherries in a baryard stall with wet boards. Pineapple skin rubbed on cedar. Socks from the attic in an old wooden box. Hints of juniper, cinnamon, cheeserind, and forest floor. Just straight up loads of Brett with plenty of stone fruit under.		On the light side of medium bodied with a crisp, drying, puckering mouthfeel. Ultra-quenching.		Dried red fruits, citrus pith, pineapple skin, and oaky resins start the palate. Malt on the lighter side and super dry. Heavy on earthy tannins, woody undertones, and barnyard funk. Nicely tart, but far short of sour and the tartness never really builds to jowel-watering levels.		Finishes with lingering cherry pits, rung out dirty socks, cheesy funk, light malt, and warming alcohol. A bone-dry farewell with fading fruit. 		Very heavy on the Brett all around, and plenty of cherries to add lots of vineous character. Certainly very complex but I find Consecration to have a greater depth of flavor. I think that T20 may have been a little juicer when fresh, but now the Brett is probably more pronounced. 	Reminds me of of a bigger Supplication, but more brett. Maybe Sanctification made it into the blend.		Side by side with Consecration, I find myself prefering the Consecration. The T20 is drier, sharper, and funkier, but the juicy, vineous, dark fruit notes of Consecration wins out in my book. My marks would also be higher for the Consecration than the T20 if it wasn't for a lackluster head.",2009-10-06 23:38:00
11.3,645,207,Trappistes Rochefort 10,Quadrupel (Quad),4.0,4.5,5.0,4.0,ritzkiss,4.5," 11.2 oz bottle bought from Buffalo, best before date of 2013, making this a 2008? Pours a dark russet brown hints of pumpkin/autumn orange on the highlights, lots of sediment in the glass. Thin khaki head that recedes to a thin leopard print pattern and then to swirls, easily agitated by the swirling of the glass, small patches of lacing stick to the glass.		Nose is lots of dark, ripe fruits - specifically grapes, figs, some raisin too but more grapish than some. Lots of fruity caramel malts, hints of spice.		This is a superbly balanced brew, probably the best quad I've had to date. Caramel, grapes, raisins, earth, biscuits, cloves, pepper, banana, hops, cocoa, and toffee. Pretty dry, which leaves it feeling more refreshing for a big brew. A touch sparkly on the carb but instead of a sharp carbonation it is more sprightly, aids the drinkability but is perhaps a touch much - if only a touch. 		Superbly drinkable for a brew this size. Very complex and engaging, makes for a nice combination in most any situation. Top notch.",2009-10-06 23:40:42
7.2,4017,454,Arcadia London Porter,English Porter,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,corby112,4.5," Pours a dark chestnut brown color with deep amber edges and a one finger beige foam head that quickly dissolves into a lasting ring. Minimal lacing in streaks and patches is left behind.		Roasted malt aroma with some hazelnut, caramel, coffee, chocolate and licorice.		Flavor is very similar to the aroma with a nice roasted malt body with hints of oatmeal and a tone of chocolate and caramel maltiness. Very smooth medium bodied beer that has a lot of silky maltiness that makes it very drinkable. There is some subtle licorice buried in there and a slightly dry hop finish.",2009-10-06 23:42:14
5.5,3523,22,ÃphÃ©mÃ¨re (Apple),Fruit / Vegetable Beer,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,briancroz12,3.0," The apple-flavored offering of Unibroue's Ephemere pours a fluffy clean white that almost immediately dissipates into thin lacing. It pours like a cloudier witbier relative. Pretty much the exact appearance one would expect from an ""apple"" flavored fruit beer.		Ephemere Apple packs a POTENT, almost artificial apple smell. I'm pretty sure it's Granny Smith, as the packaging hints. A more trained nose may also pick up on remote hints of cinnamon and perhaps nutmeg.		The taste is crisp, carbonated and exclusively apple. Personally, I enjoy the taste of apple pie, but this one is a bit too strong on the flavoring. I'd almost go as far as to say it tastes like a very fine cider, but I wouldn't want to knock an outstanding brewery like Unibroue. The taste is adequate, and I do enjoy it. However, I just don't feel like this is how a beer should taste, even a fruit beer. It's too close to a cider in my opinion. The presence of a malty backbone and virtually no hoppy notes should also be noted.		Despite the lackluster taste, phmre Apple is still above-average in the mouthfeel & drinkability categories. Fans of fruit beers, apples and sweeter-tasting brews will all enjoy this, while fans of bigger beers will laugh in the face of phmre.		Although I purchased this at the end of August, I purposely waited until the New England Autumn to review this (apple) beer. My experiement definately passed, but not with flying colors. This one gets the job done as a crisp, light beer on a summer evening. It ALSO does the job as a nice after meal beer on a cool October evening in New England. The problem is, it just ""gets the job done."" There's absolutely nothing spectacular about this one, but at the same time, I didn't mind drinking it at all.",2009-10-06 23:42:58
5.1,2296,751,Moose Drool Brown Ale,American Brown Ale,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,nms1987,4.0," Deep dark brown color with kind of a reddish, muddy edge to it. Decent foamage.		Malty nose with some roastiness to it. Maybe a little floral hoppiness to it.		The roastiness comes through on the palate too. It starts off your typical smooth, slightly sweet brown ale in a very enjoyable way but by the time the finish gets around I'm getting some dry roasting. This stuff is almost porter ish. Very interesting.		Smooth mouthfeel and a pleasure to drink.",2009-10-06 23:43:13
5.0,35134,3,Pecan Harvest Ale,American Brown Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,homebrewhawk,3.5," 12oz. brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a slightly hazy reddish gold with a thin whitehead.

As usual, they have all the relevant information easily available.		Appearance: Clear golden and a bit effervescent. Nice sized head, dense with pretty good retention.		Smell: Peppery hops, some varied grain flavors. Definitely appealing. 		Taste: Definitely hop forward, but not bitter. Spicy and peppery hop flavors, with a bit of the flavor I associate with rye beers.		Overall impression: Definitely a drinkable offering, I tried this on draft and wasn't impressed - but I'm really enjoying the six pack, so maybe it was my taste buds or the lines or something.",2009-10-06 23:46:54

S - biting sweet smell of honey and flowers.		T - sweet, spicy with a strong spice kick at the end. almost tart, but not quite. 		M - for such a light looking beer this definitely packs a punch, and is a well carbonated beer. not a gusher, but you can feel the bubbles racing over your tongue.

Minimal lacing.		Malty aroma with some peppery spice and dark fruit notes especially dark cherries.		Spicy peppery flavor up front that lingers over the medium malty body into a medicinal cough syrup flavor with some dark fruit notes, mostly cherries, raisin and plum.

Bitter hops and a subtle yeast character in the nose. Very bitter in flavor, whites of an orange rind, pretzel dough malt structure, yeasty. More of an English meets Belgian approach, interesting but lacking. Light in body, well carbonated and overall easy to drink.",2009-10-06 23:49:01

Good amount of lacing clings to the edges of the glass.		S: The first word that came to my mind was ""fresh."" The nose was a very clean, bright, and invigorating combination of grapefruit, pineapple and other citrus notes. Some toffee like malts form a nice canvas for the bright bitter notes to pop like paint on a Jackson Pollock painting.		T: Much of the same here. To steal a line or two from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels... ""I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest! You could fall in love with an orangutan in that!"" ... Very nice tropical fruit flavoring with a nice bitter edge.		M: Medium bodied with healthy carbonation and a nice oily and refreshing finish.

Smells of charred bread, unsweetened chocolate, lactose, & a little bonus of sweet unfermentables. Touch of smoke coming off it too.		Taste was pretty nice for what is considered a middle of the road imperial stout these days. Very nice mix of charred malt & sharp, bittersweet cocoa. Small trace of coffee grounds. Almost sooty with roast. Milky, but not syrupy. Lots of rich/caramelized sugars, but still cut & thinned by the strong carbonation. Finish was a little leathery, lingering with ash & earth.		The alcohol was totally overshadowed by the roast & stiff carbonation. Only showing itself going down, & occasionally, coming back up. *Burp*		Thanks Luke. :)",2009-10-06 23:58:37
7.5,52043,651,ELEVEN,Milk / Sweet Stout,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,IBUnit63,4.0," Was happy to see this in the vicinity, so finally I'm pouring it into a Portsmouth snifter...		Wow - this head is bready...lots of muffin tunnels...a fair amount of light maple candy color. Sort of like a heady root beer. Color isn't quite espresso dark; it's more like Dunkin iced coffee dark. Would expect a little more thickness, but it still looks good. Decent retention.		The scent is sort of like a tinny version of Peche Mortel. A shitload of coffee smacks the nose like a 4th-line goon in a hockey fight. A very dry slate-like character and a fair amount of hop grass rounds this out.		Y'know, I'm getting a lot of smoke here. Smoke...or slate...or charcoal dust. Very husky with a rauch-like tendency. A bit of warmth cleans it up to reveal some HUGE malt and coffee notes. It's interesting how quickly this burns off and is a nice reminder about letting beers breathe for at least a few minutes.		It may be psychological but the coffee flavor feels like it's pulsing through my veins at the moment. Very dry and slate-like. Hop grass mixes actually quite well with the coffee to create a little balance with the hardcore chocolate and roasted malts. It's a little uneven, albeit very good, and I'm still not sure how warm or cold to drink this. Definitely not enough weight at room temperature but cold would be a waste. A freaky tweener, this Eleven.		I'm finding myself ready to devour this, even though I don't know what to make of it. The coffee has transformed me to The Great Cornholio so I'm bouncing off the fucking walls at the moment. ""Butt-head, what happened to Beavis?"" ""He like ate 27 candy bars...and then he drank a 6-pack of root beer..."" ""...Nicar-AGUA...AGUA for my bung-hooole..."" OK, I'll stop now...wait, didn't Beavis pull that shit at a coffeehouse spoken word night or something? Obviously I watched too much TV in 1995 - and forgot even more of it...",2009-10-07 00:00:15

Decided to try it again just to see if I'd gotten an old bottle. I'm glad I did - this sample was much more enjoyable.		Pours a nice orange color with not a whole lot of head - dissipates almost immediately. Smell is of citrusy hops. Taste is similar. The citrus and cascade hops are really noticeable, but it's not really bitter. There's a slight hint of spice here. Quite drinkable, especially if you're a fan of the style.",2009-10-07 00:01:50

Deep, deep red and basically black, it has a big tan head slowly shirnking and leaving a little bit of weak lace.		The aroma is rich dried figs, caramelised dark raisins, hints of chocolate and coffee, smoke, toffee.		The taste is rich but not to heavy, complex, highly balanced. It is faintly smokey, with dark caramelised fruits, hints of spices, hints of leather (as the bottle indicates- I didn't notice it at first but it comes on clearly after a few sips), light hints of bourbon, stronger near the finish. It tends slightly towards the sweetish side, but not cloyingly so, with a little faint bitterness, spice, and alcoholic warmth to help balance and carry it, however all of these are tame and the result is smooth. It is highly drinkable for the strength.",2009-10-07 00:02:32

It is bronze with a smattering of froth but offers little by way of actual flavor. A distant wash of sweetness with some grainy tang and marshmallow punkiness defines its minimalist core attributes. 		""You're welcome,"" seems to be a theme at Iron Horse. It's printed on their coasters and a portrait of Sammy Davis Jr. above the bar extends the same sentiment. You're Welcome is workable for what it is, but there's not much beer here and on the grand scheme of things, beers such as this are meaningless.",2009-10-07 00:03:30

Smell: roasted malt, chocolate, and alcohol are easy to pull from the glass but is not as pleasant as hoped.		Taste: this is a complex beer as roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon tones, prune sweetness, and some espresso. Alcohol is quite noticeable here. Bitterness is moderate.

S: This is a unique beer. Unlike most coffee infused beers, this doesn't come across as roasted or burnt coffee. Instead, it is straight freshly ground coffee beans. Take some fresh ground coffee and rub it between your fingers right under your nose, and thats the smell of the Coffee Bender. Light caramel, toffee and nutty malts are in the background.		T: The fresh ground aroma doesn't translate as well to the flavor profile. By no means is it bad. It just loses that ""freshness"" of the coffee. The coffee is more of a roasted flavor here, and the malts shine through nicely.		M: Smooth, medium bodied. Lingering aftertaste. Solid carbonation from the can.		D: A very nice, if not unique, brew that anyone who enjoys a little coffee in their beer should take a chance on. There is a reason why Coffee Bender (and its kid brother Bender) rock the top of the American Brown Ale charts. They are that good.",2009-10-07 00:08:17

Good sized white foam head falls to a light covering of the brew, leaves a strong lace presence. 		Mild hop nose. Nose has a bit of a sweet scent to it as well. 		Rather bold flavor.

The pour leaves a foamy eggshell head that dissipates into a thin film with spotty lacing. The body is the color of a well-used penny, the exact color you think of when you think of Autumn. 		As much as I try to get pumpkin on the nose I just can't. I get a touch of cinnamon and sweet malt and some mushy pears. If this beer was an aromatic candle I wouldn't light it.		The taste isn't a ton better. The spices aren't really there for me, maybe a touch of nutmeg. There's some mustiness especially on the back end. My palate was uninspired. 		Mouthfeel was unspectacular, perhaps a bit thin with some lackadaisical carbonation.		Either this beer changed in the last year or my palate evolved/devolved. If you call yourself a pumpkin beer I don't want to have to search for pumpkin, just give it to me already!",2009-10-07 00:08:21

Head retention is good, protecting the beer for maximum drinking pleasure.		S - Smells like a sweet stout with plenty of residual sugar. Chocolate and other mild roasty aromas, nothing crazy.		T - Light chocolate and sweet. Pretty mild, I hate to compare to Guinness but this seems like a big brother to Guinness in terms of flavor. Quite similar just bigger and more aggressive without being crazy over the top like a lot of stouts can be.		M/D - A bit sticky but otherwise easy to drink.

Not much life on it, but nice wave like lacing left behind after each gulp (yes, gulp... more on that later).		S: Dark chocolate, licorice, roasted coffee and.... a shit ton of booze.		T: A muddled version of the nose. The heat from the booze just masks anything that might have been stellar here. You certainly get some coffee, caramel, chocolate, and licorice... but is hard to enjoy.		M: Medium bodied, good carbonation. Way too much heat.		D: Tough. It wasn't a drain pour, but this beer simply is not ready for consumption.

A: Pours a clear, light amber with lots of carbonation and a half-inch head of quickly-dissipating white foam; a little bit of lace. Not bad looking at all, but nothing special here.		S: Very crisp aroma of toasty malts and understated (but definitely present) hops; reminiscent of a pilsner. Just what I was looking for in a lager this style.		T: Follows the nose with the toasted grain and mild hops, but then takes another spin around the block with just a hint of caramel sweetness peeking out before the final dry finish. The hops bitterness doesn't really add much to the beer, though, just a bit of mustiness. I'd prefer this beer if it emphasized the malt a bit more.		M: Fairly light-bodied with some spiky carbonation. Meh.		D: Very crisp and refreshing, this is undoubtedly a sessionable brew.		Notes: Of the many entries in the Leinie's lineup in recent years, this is one of my favorites. There's really nothing off about it (although the musty hops weren't exactly my cup of tea), and it's refreshing without being low on flavor. Solid, if thoroughly unspectacular, beer.",2009-10-07 00:17:30

Mouthfeel is full bodied. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Leaves a sweet coating on the mouth. 		D. This one goes down smooth.

Appearance: Pours an almost opaque amber color with a large, pourous, orange-ish head that leaves lace all over as it goes down.		Smell: Smells sweet and malty, with a large amount of toastiness, a touch of earthiness, and a hint of the tea-like smell I find in all Rogue beers.		Taste: Starts toasty and a bit sweet, with a weak bitter finish. Only a hint of Rogue's tea taste in this. Almost perfect balance between the malt at the beginning and the hops at the end.		Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and smooth with a light carbonation.

The color is a hazy orange/amber with some foamy off white head and some nice lacing that leaves a film on the glass.		The smell is very hoppy with some citrus and floral hop flavors jumping out at the nose. A spicy mix of flavors await.		The taste is pretty mellow compared to the wallop expected from this triple IPA. The hop effect seems to come on rather quietly as you sip. Just the right amount of a warming, soothing feel mixed with the great hoppy bitterness makes this beer a nice surprise for it's quiet hop flavor that does bot pronounce itself too loudly.		The feel is quite light is just right for a hoppy monster. Just the right amount of hops and get about the night amount of funk.",2009-10-07 00:19:37
7.5,1575,73,Great Lakes Commodore Perry IPA,English India Pale Ale (IPA),4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,Hojaminbag,3.5," A very clear, golden colored body with a ton of fast moving strands of carbonation bubbles. A little lighter hue than the average IPA. A soapy looking, bright white head that rises two fingers above the head and has some pretty good retention.		The aroma has its share of bittering hops and a bit of cracker-like malt aroma, but it has a primarily fruity smell that has pineapple and grapefruit. A good bit of grassy hops in there also.		Up front the bittering hops assert themselves, bringing a flavor of grapefruit with them. After that the grassy aroma asserts itself as a grassy flavor. In the middle I start to notice the cracker malt backbone. I would say the malt is a little lighter than what you find in a lot of IPAs, although I wouldn't call this difference positive or negative. The finish is bright a fruity, with some more grapefruit, pineapple, and maybe evenb a touch of apricot.		Mouthfeel is moderate in carbonation and body, and has a nice oily finish.		Pretty drinkable IPA, Commodore Perry IPA is definitely another quality brew from Great Lakes.",2009-10-07 00:20:14

On to the beer:		Very dark red, almost on the verge of being brown or a reddish violet. Great holding head, nice thin rings of lacing. This is a very hoppy and fruity tasting beer. First you get the burst of hop resin on the palate before you get the major fruity esters. The bitterenss grows on you as you drink more of it. Alcohol is hidden well, and it goes down easy for its size. Ideal for hop maniacs. Personally, I prefer all three Bastards over this.",2009-10-07 00:20:21
4.0,36672,13014,Bitter Brewer,English Bitter,4.5,4.0,4.5,3.5,jlindros,4.5," Got this nice lookin tall boy in a big Surly-fest trade with grub. Poured it into my semi pint with bubble on the top NERAX glass. 		A: It starts with a nice pop as it smacks open and squirts a little beer at me teasing me for whats to come. It pours with a ridiculous head that takes up about 1/3 of the glass. The thick but fluffy head slowly pops its way back. It's a brilliantly clear pale amber orange color with a slight tan color.		N: Nose reminds me a lot of brewing. It has a mash like aroma of malts, some hops and a slight yeast. The hops are pretty nice smelling but not as strong as the Furious obviously. The hops definitely remind me of throwing them into the boil. The American hops aren't super hoppy, but have a nice floral and citrus, possibly Cascade or Amarillo. I get some grapefruit as well.		T: Taste is very raw and fresh ingredients. It's got some raw sweetness still but has a very strong raw malt taste. I think the low alcohol and low gravity make it have that raw wort taste. Very much reminds me of tasting the wort before it ferments, but much less sweet, although it does have some sweetness to it. Some more grapefruit, citrus, and floral tasting hops, and some grassy hops, come through but are still pretty light. I also get some raw hop taste, like chewing on the hops but much less bitter. A nice malty taste really shines through and contrasts the nice hop taste and bitterness. It's a pretty well rounded and complex taste.		M: Semi light, decent carbonation. 		F: Finishes semi bitter and pretty dry compared to the starting sweetness. It clears off the palate well. It almost has a feel that you didn't even drink it, but there's a very slight lingering bitterness, and some slight grapefruit taste that hang around for a bit to remind you the delicious beverage in your glass. Pretty light and surprisingly refreshing of a bitter beer. 		Final thoughts: This is a very easy drinking and delicious beer. It's got a great malt quality and hop taste as well as some bitterness that all blend together well. It reminds me very much of a British style IPA but American hops instead, which makes sense since it is American hops with British malts. Has a lot of fresh brewing tastes, the aromas, the malt taste, the hop taste, all of it reminds me of brewing. All of that, plus it comes in a tall boy can. Wow, I so wish I could get more Surly!",2009-10-07 00:22:15

D- Coming out in the fall when all I want is big hops and looking forward to stouts and barleywines and yet this is so refreshing. I could drink so many of these. This is a huge contender to my summer favorite Gumballhead. Really well done, Metro. I'm a fan again.",2009-10-07 00:37:47
11.2,49286,3818,Mokah,American Double / Imperial Stout,3.5,5.0,4.0,4.0,nick76,3.5, The aroma is exactly like chocolate milk with coffee and toasted malt. The alcohol is well hidden. The appearance is dark brown with a smaller tan head. The taste has the same elements as the aroma but the bitterness is overpowering and unexpected since the aroma has no hops. The palate is smooth and almost thick but right about what I was expecting. Overall a fantastic smelling beer now they need to match the taste to it.,2009-10-07 00:38:17
5.0,53159,765,Trafalgar Hop Nouveau 2009,American Pale Ale (APA),3.5,3.5,4.5,4.0,Derek,4.0," Hop Nouveau 2009 Wet Hopped Pale Ale. 5% abv.		Hops picked in Tillsonburg on Sept 6, 2009; brewed the same day; bottled Sept 21; delivered Sept 25th.		I'm not sure what's more impressive, the fact that an Ontario brewer picked fresh, wet hops and brewed with them on the same day (on a large scale), or the fact that it went through the LCBO testing and was on the shelf by the end of the month!		A: Hazy, brownish-straw with a white head, thin ring of retention, slight lacing.		S: Peppery spice, grass & floral hops with hints of grainy biscuit from the malt. Could use a little more late hop additions for some more aroma.		T: Nice grassy spicing, some floral & citrus, underlying toffee & grainy biscuits, good bitterness. Some good hop flavour.		M: The body is on the low side of moderate, light hop acidity, off-dry finish.		D: A really good drinker.		It's not a big IPA like the Sierra Nevada or some of the pacific northwest wet-hopped brews, but it's got some great hop flavour and it's seriously drinkable. The hop heads might expect a little more flavour, but this could be appealing to a larger audience (a gateway to wet-hopped brews?). With the vintage on the bottle, I'm hopeful that they'll continue brewing this for years to come.		This is a great addition to the local brewing scene. Cheers to Trafalgar for being the first in Ontario to use locally grown hops in a wet-hopped ale (on a commercial scale).		Think Global, Drink Local.",2009-10-07 00:38:42
8.6,38394,3818,Pumking,Pumpkin Ale,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Jayli,4.0," consumed 9/28	This beer pours a a nice bright orangey copper color with a 1/2 finger of off white head that recedes rapidly, leaving wispy spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. The nose is amazing. I have to say, I just kept going back to smell this one before every sip..and sometimes just to smell it. Nose is mainly of pumpkin,butter, vanilla, and just the right amount of spices. Most pumpkin beers go all out with spices, but the spice are more a background hint in this beer. Taste is some caramel malts up front lending to a buttery, pumpkin flavoring, hint of vanilla mingle and finishes with a touch of nutmeg, more pumpkin and vanilla. Medium bodied, mild carbonation, nice creamy mouth feel, slightly oily in the finish. I like me some pumpkin beers, so I could session this one any day, any time.",2009-10-07 00:38:49
7.5,53039,273,Sweetwater Dank Tank Wet Dream,American Amber / Red Ale,2.5,3.0,4.0,2.0,ahurd11085,3.0," Picked up a 22oz bomber today...Had high hopes for this one as I love hoppy red ales, and despite what many people feel about it, I love the Chinook hop. Maybe I was asking for too much, but was really let down by this one...		A: Good clarity, nice deep amber/red color...vigorous pour yielded a weak 1 finger thin head that quickly disappeared with no trace...no lacing on the glass at any point.		S: Very appealing notes of pine resins, some citrus fruits, and nice spiciness. The problem was that these notes were all VERY faint. A bit of the toast from the grain on the nose.		T: Some really awesome flavors coming through...but they are just too weak and watery. This tastes like a great Imperial Red, such as Stone 13 cut down with 1/3 pure water. The beer has a nice balance between toasty, nutty malt flavor the piney spicy hops...but both need to be amped up substantially		M: Worst part of the beer. VERY thin and watery with no malt body or hop slickness.		D: This beer does have superior drinkability. It does go down quite easily, and I would have no problem putting down many pints. Unfortunately thats not really what I look for in my beers that put the name Imperial into their style.		Overall a decent beer, but not a good imperial red. Seems to be the Dank Tank theme...a good beer, but not really close to what it is being sold as.",2009-10-07 00:38:56
5.2,607,192,Fat Tire Amber Ale,American Amber / Red Ale,3.5,3.5,5.0,3.5,Kraken,4.5," Reviewed from notes. Consumed 8/4/09		Poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard water glass. Firm pour evokes a 3/4 inch head consisting of fine white bubbles. No lace. Color is a clear golden copper.		Nose- Mild hop profile balanced with a touch of caramel malt.		Pallate- A very nice, balanced amber ale. Plenty of nutty slightly chewy caramels, coupled with a crisp refreshing, slightly lemon citric hop bite. Hops are not over powering, but rather a faintly tart and bitter compliment. Wonderfully executed.		Mouthfeel- Active, faintly tart.		Drinkability- Great, magnificent session beer.",2009-10-07 00:38:56
4.8,6711,2854,Flensburger Dunkel,Munich Dunkel Lager,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.0,drpimento,3.5," Nice beer. Got this bottle a couple of weeks ago at Surdyk's in Minneapolis. Opened with a rousing POP and poured with a nice foamy, frothy tan head and some lace. Head mostly settled down soon. Color is clear dark amber - brown with some dark red orange highlights. Aroma was dark malt, cocoa, earth, and a little roastiness. Flavor is about the same and well balanced. Not much sweetness nor too much of anything, really. Body is nice and so is carbonation. Real easy drinking beer. Nice clean finish. Definitely a session.",2009-10-07 00:39:31
5.8,40999,96,Lucky Kat,American IPA,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,corby112,2.0, Pours a clear amber orange with a fizzy one finger beige head that quickly fades into thin ring. Not much in the lacing department.		Very earthy dirt hop aroma with some dry pine notes and a bit of caramel malt that has some nut and biscuit character. 		Very watered down with a lot of literally earthy hops up front that taste like dirt with a caramel biscuit malt backbone that provides a bit of balance and a very odd unpleasant metallic aftertaste.,2009-10-07 00:40:37
8.5,52373,423,Seeyoulator Doppelbock,Doppelbock,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,GbVDave,4.5," Poured from a corked and caged 750ml bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet. Extra special thanks to thehand for the trade!		Batch Number: 1-2009 7/10		A: Pours a cloudy and hazy reddish amber color. Covering this is a gorgeous looking, khaki-colored, three finger dallop of cream on top. Retention was awesome and the ropes and splotches of lace left behind were beautiful.		S: Toasty malt (caramel, toffee, and nuts) was in full effect along with spices, green apple, berries, a touch of alcohol, and cedar. As it came up to temp it started to smell like one of those cedar sashays (sp?) that you throw in your closet to keep it smelling good.		T: Much like above with more of a toasted malt and roasty nut flavor. Earthy and grassy hops, dried herbs, slightly tangy apples, vanilla, spices, cedar, and coconut. Did I mention I'm a sucker for cedar?		M: Surprisingly spicy and bitter, for the style. I expected greater sweetness but was rewarded with a refreshing peppery spiciness. Likely due to the cedar.		D: Man, do I dig the beers in the Smokestack Series! I don't usually drink doppelbocks, but after this I may have to work more of them into my rotation!",2009-10-07 00:41:23
6.1,56973,132,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,Oatmeal Stout,4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,MeisterBurger,4.0," Pours an impenetrably deep black with a rich tan head that retains nicely. Rings of lace linger beautifully after every sip.		The aroma is roast and cascade hops, nice and fruity, slightly piney, with hints of milk chocolate and caramel.		The taste is very roast forward but perfectly so, very dry, intense and smooth at the same time--pine bitterness lingers long in the finish. Definitely has a coffee grinds taste going on.		The mouthfeel is creamy, just a notch below full bodied, and the carbonation is spot on.		Overall just a great drinker, really nice and roasty and dry and balanced to perfection.",2009-10-07 00:41:33
5.3,108,35,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,jhammel01,4.0," Pours a golden straw color that cloudy with a fluffy head. It keeps a soapy lace all the way down. Beer is nice and healthy as its out of the new harvest collection and is fresh until Jan 10. Looks like a typical wheat beer. For some reason, I expected it to be red.		All I smell are cherries! cherries and some malt background. Much much else happening.		I was actually quite surprised by the 1st initial taste. I like it! It reminds me of Magic Hats Wacko if you've ever had it. This beer has a front of cherry that is nicely balanced with a bit of malt flavor in the background that finishes with plenty of sourdough bready goodness. 		I liked this one. It was well balanced and enjoyable. Not the overpowering cherry tart I was expecting...I pleasant surprise.",2009-10-07 00:41:39

5.1,38366,35,Samuel Adams Dunkelweizen,Dunkelweizen,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,burnstar,3.0, Pours a murky brown with a medium sized head. Smell is spicy wheat with a bit of caramel. Taste has a very mild sweetness. A roasted grainy flavor. A bit of spicy wheat. Herbal flavor in the finish. Maybe a touch watery. Overall a decent dunkel for an American version.,2009-10-07 00:42:17
5.0,3567,1141,Paienne,American Blonde Ale,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,mrmanning,2.5," Bottle- A pale straw pour emits a fluffy white foam. Grassy nose is also grainy and has an aroma of cooked vegetable as well. Sweet grainy flavour upfront, overly grassy, tastes of weird biscuit. Strange stuff overall. Creamy finish with odd aftertaste too. Proof that great breweries also make a crappy beer or two.",2009-10-07 00:42:19

S: Well blended mix of pumpkin accompanied by cloves, and other spices. 		T: Starts with a medium pumpkin taste and finished with a variety of spices. 		M: Light bodied, crisp and low-medium carbonation		D: Very enjoyable, the spices make you want to enjoy the beer longer. It could use more focus on the pumpkin than the spice.

6.0,206,68,Road Dog Porter,American Porter,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,anexetastos,4.0," I'm going to judge this as a robust porter (AJCP profile 12B as opposed to a brown porter 12A, because it seems to fit better there; forgive me if i'm erroneous). 		Aroma: nice roasty aroma; roasted grains obvious in the nose. No noticeable hop aroma, as it should be. No diacetyl. 		Color: a little on the light side, but very clean. no contamination at all either in the nose or the appearance.		Flavor: nice moderate roasty flavor; pleasant black malt presence; nice acidic/tannic finish from the roasted grains, but not overwhelming; very balanced here.		Mouthfeel: bubbly; a bit over-carbonated on this one, but the second one was fine (anaomoly on the first).		Overall impression: the motto says plenty: ""Good beer. No shit""",2009-10-07 00:46:55
9.5,26159,1339,Urthel Hop-It,Belgian IPA,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,Kraken,4.0," Reviewed from notes. Consumed 8/5/09		Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into an over sized water glass. Slight pour yields a scant head. Very nice lace. Color is a very cloudy orange with tons of suspended sediment.		Nose- Heavy overripe orange, some lemon zest. Characteristically ""Belgian"" yeastiness.		Pallate- Interesting. A very Belgian interpretation of a ""Hoppy"" golden. Some lemon citrus, a hint of pepper, and some banana. Booziness enters the taste equation near the end. Some subtle sweetness and bitterness in the finish.		Mouthfeel- Very active. Slightly syrupy.		Drinkability- Fairly drinkable, although a bit strong.",2009-10-07 00:47:15
8.5,46937,651,Alphalpha,American Double / Imperial IPA,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,ppoitras,4.5," 750ml bottle from charlew, thanks man! Black plastic ""foil"", Batch E!013.		Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" off-white head over the effervescent clear golden brew. Head rises boldly, but does not overflow, with a meringuey island in the center, and tons of chunky lacing. Aroma is fresh pine, through and through. Taste starts sweet, goes pine in the middle, which carries through to the end to mesh with the alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth, a sometimes rare feat for the style, and drinkability is excellent. Great representation of the style.",2009-10-07 00:47:17
5.8,20512,1853,Oktoberfest,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,Finn,4.0," This Fest beer is an incredibly clear, deep gold color. The aroma is biscuits, light fruit, munich malt, and a mild metallic zing in the nose. the head has a little staying power, and a thin but fine film clings to the surface. Flavor is excellent, and a bit more unique than other US oktoberfests I've tried: A tad more hoppy than your average, which works well in this beer. There is a fair amount of malt sweetness, with a tad of astringency to it. Also not a bad thing so far. Medium-bodied and moderate carbonation. this is a tasty and unique oktoberfest, I'd say half between the american oktoberfest and german oktoberfest in flavor, and refinement. Not your everyday oktoberfest, a little more bold with the hops. Highly drinkable.",2009-10-07 00:48:26
8.0,45017,7730,Doppelt IPA - Double India Pale Ale,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,mikesgroove,4.5," So I think this is supposed to be a big IPA, though I have to admit it drank much more like imperial red ale. Served cold and poured into several tasting glasses, we all enjoyed this one tremendously on 10/04/2009.		 		Rich caramel color is very evident coming right out of the gate on the one. Huge foaming white head of light tan came up and over the top and settled down nice and quickly really giving it a very nice overall look complete with tons of side glass lacing. Nice big piney hops are coming out right up front on me. Rich caramel malts, hints of pine tar and a really full flavor are all coming together now to form a very tight and well put together aroma. Such a smooth, sweet flavor coming off of this one right away, quite impressed here again as the flavor seems to really pop here and push the piney hops way up front before mellowing out mid palate and really showing some quality depth. Smooth, subtle ABV then kicks in and it's over. This one is a fine sipper I would have no issue at all with trying any day,		 		Overall this was about as solid as they come and really stole the show quite nicely for me. I would love to be able to have this one again, it was just that damn good.",2009-10-07 00:49:46
5.1,1597,132,St. Rogue Red,American Amber / Red Ale,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,Docer,4.0," Grabbed a 12 oz. bottle of this just to try... right after having a Green Flash Hop Head Red...		- Bubbly beige head... down to lots of lacing.. pillowed over a cloudy caramel/molasses sun-tea of a brew.		- Very sweet malt.. caramel, brown sugar.... smells like it ought to be an imperial.... nice bitter pine and citrus hop... really bright but mellowed by the massive malt that Rogue is well known for in many of their imperial brews....		- Flavor is much more smooth and mild than the nose leads you to believe.... almost a candied roasted caramel malt with a tough of roasted nuts or hazelnut. Rather nice really.... and light. Nice bitter hop floating around there too... pine, and a zing.		- Overall a bit dry, but a nice balanced zest brings about the saliva.		- Overall this isn't a bad red at all. I could use a 7% triple dry-hopped version... but this will do as a fantastic session brew. Price was a bit steep on the 6-pack. But that has nothing to do w/ my judging of the actual beer or review here.",2009-10-07 00:49:56
5.0,53110,20220,Black Creek Porter,English Porter,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,Derek,3.0," Served at C'est what from a wooden cask!		A: Black. ZERO head.		S: Licorice, sherry and a little foot-like cheese aroma.		T: Licorice, plenty of wood, winey (is the wood fooling my tastebuds?), fruity, molasses, good bitterness.		M: Light to moderate body, no carbonation.		D: Definitely below average for a porter.",2009-10-07 00:50:43
11.0,46302,7730,Sahti,Sahti,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,mikesgroove,4.0," I have been a big fan of the style ever since the first one I tried and this again was no exception. Served chilled and poured into my terrapin snifter, this one was consumed on 10/03/2009.		 		Very nice our here, rich honey colored amber and nice and cloudy with a light touch of white head sitting up on the top. Subtle lacing leans back against the side of the glass and really keeps the profile nice and alive looking. Aroma is sweet, lots of honey here with really nice touches of herbal and flavor notes dancing around in the background. Smooth, even flavor here with it being over 11% is actually quite shocking as none of it really was that noticeable at all. Lots of sweet honey flavors again all over the one and the profile were done quite well. A bit of a biggie, especially given the ABV, but again a very solid representation of the style.		 		Overall I thought this one was very nicely done. Rich and smooth with a really well done profile. I really enjoyed nearly every sip of it and think the juniper and berries added in the mix really rounded out the flavor quite nicely, I would have no issue at all with trying this one again.",2009-10-07 00:50:59
8.5,52828,147,Kona Coffee Macadamia Coconut Porter,American Porter,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,womencantsail,4.0," A: I poured this into my Cigar City snifter to reveal a thick, black, beer with a small mocha colored head.		S: The coffee is very dominant in this beer. It overwhelms the other scents at first. However, a bit of sniffing lets the chocolatey porter aromas come through, and the coconut really lends the beer a sweet smell. The nuttiness from the macadamia nuts is present, but mild.		T: As with the nose, the coffee flavor is really the star of the show. The coconut gives the beer a definite sweetness, and becomes more pronounced as the beer warms up. The macadamia nut is also subdued when the beer is chilled, but allow it to come closer to room temperature and it makes an appearance. There is a slight bitterness, which I assume is from the coffee, but it is balanced nicely by the coconut.		M: This beer has a nice viscosity to it and a smooth mouthfeel. The carbonation is much higher than you would have expected, but it provides a nice contrast.		D: I'm generally not the biggest coffee fan, but I am in love with this beer. There are such a variety of flavors and aromas that make it such an interesting beer to drink. I'm glad I've got a few more stashed away.",2009-10-07 00:51:17
10.0,945,173,Adam,Old Ale,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,beermanbrian,5.0," I've been wanting to try this one for years. Old Ale's are a crazy style having huge range of taste. I've loved some, hated some. Let's see where this one stands.		Dark almost black color with the slightest hints of red. Foamy tan head, mimimal lace. Looking good so far, the old ales i've really liked are the darker ones.		Smell of dark fruits, figs. Some roasted malt and a hint of chocolate. Again this is a crazy style that you never know what you are going to get. This one is a cross between barley wine and RIS. 		Full chewy body with some alcohol burn on the finish but it dosn't become cloying. 		This one didn't let me down. An excellent brew that exceeded my expectations. This style is still a surprise every time I have one, but it is a pleasant surpise more often than not.",2009-10-07 00:51:41
7.9,5527,1590,Industrial IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,mikesgroove,4.5," Picked this one up as an extra in a BIF and just got around to trying it. Served cold and poured into a pint glass, this one was consumed on 10/02/2009.		 		The pour was very nicely done. Rich amber in color with a huge billowing head of white that came up and over the top and settled down nicely into a firm pillow of lace that dropped tons of nice lacing up and down the sides of the glass. Rich aroma of pungent grapefruit and rich orange notes that really just carried over wonderfully. Warming brought some light balance to it, but it will still done, very, very well. Each sip seemed a bit bigger then the one before. Huge notes of pineapple and grapefruit are quickly thrown together with some very nice touches of caramel malts. Nice medium body was well carbonated and the smooth, delicate flavor hid the ABV quite well.		 		Overall I have to admit this one was very well done. I would have no issue at all with trying another one any day. Really top notch stuff. I would have to recommend this one to anyone.",2009-10-07 00:52:18
11.2,19960,1199,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),American Double / Imperial Stout,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,beertooth,4.5," I decided to crack a 2009 vintage bottle tonight to see how it's aging. 12oz bottle poured into a goblet.		This beer is very dark brown to black with a finger of very silky chocolate milk colored head. The head fades into a thin layer and leaves very spotted lacing.		The nose is full of coffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and baker's chocolate. It smells delicious! 		The first sip hits me with coffee and bourbon. I'm actually getting a lot more bourbon in this now than when it was fresh. The vanilla and chocolate come next and are rounded out with some oaky tannins and alcohol. There's a slight bitter finish that lingers in between sips. The alcohol isn't hot, but it is warming.		Mouthfeel is full and creamy with low carbonation, but I wouldn't say it's slick.		One of the best imperial stouts out there and a must try if you haven't already. I can't wait for the next release.",2009-10-07 00:52:28
5.2,19685,9629,Short's Bellaire Brown Ale,American Brown Ale,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.0,taylorhamrick,3.5," Nice color, fairly clear, though a bit of yeast falls in at the finish. It's kind of a reddish brown, not like a brown on the blacker side. With a kind of thin head, about a cm or so, and it looks pretty loose, doesn't leave much lacing. Smells pretty good, like some burnt caramellized sugars, a hint of chocolate in the background, and a very nice clean sweetness in the beer. Nice and grainy I think, this fits the bill of a nice brown ale. Nothing excessive, everything in nice balance. The taste has all the things from the smell, with a tiny bit of sweet coffee thrown in there too. Starts on a nice little roasty, toasty note, comes in a bit grainy, like raw grainy, then it gets a bit sweet, with the nice burnt sugars, and a bit of bread too. All of the flavors kind of blend in nicely in the end, with some good cleanness. I like the taste, but it's not a standout, one of the beers you could drink often, but I doubt if I would crave it. The body is kind of thin I think, with a burst of carbonation at the start, and it disappears quickly. It's quite alright, but nothing too great. The drinkability is probably the best part. Nice and interesting, not a heavy hitter, nice balance, and despite the lighter body, is satisfying and enjoyable. I would reach for another if I didn't have something else to drink.",2009-10-07 00:52:30
5.4,221,71,Fuller's London Porter,English Porter,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,therica,4.5," A grand porter against which to judge others.		A= deep mahogany chocolate red-brown, with a light layer of head.		S= very inviting; burnt chocolate, some coffee, and hints of spices & hops.		T= dry coffee residue on the tongue which seems to add to the light bitterness of the hops; burnt chocolate; occasional flashes of prune.		M- light dry coffee residue, lingering burnt chocolate bitterness mixed with mild sweetness depending on which part of the tongue and tastebuds are reporting.		D= very drinkable if you like dark stuff, and even if you don't then you'll probably find new enlightenment from this beer.",2009-10-07 00:53:39
6.1,12323,696,Thomas Hooker Octoberfest Lager,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Ezekiel81923,4.0," 12oz bottle poured into my Philadelphia Eagle pint glass. I'm a fan of Thomas Hooker so I have big expectations of this one.		Appearance: Deep, dark amber color that allows some light through. Thick, pillowy off-white head fills the pint glass to the top before receding to a thin film sitting on top of the beer in about 45 seconds. Nice lacing.		Smell: Sweet caramel malts aroma that sometimes smells slightly nutty. Slight toasted grain aroma as well.		Taste: Sweet malty flavors dominates at first, as you would expect. Slightly toasted flavor lends way to a caramel backing as the aroma sort of suggested. Good hoppy finish that lends some herbal flavor and some slight bitterness that tickles a little as it goes down.		Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy. As mentioned, a slightly drying, prickly bitterness sits in the back of your throat after you swallow. Interesting.		Drinkability: A bit filling, but most octoberfest's are. Could handle quite a few of these nonetheless.		This one pulls through in my book. Glad I bought a case, should last me a good while.",2009-10-07 00:54:14
9.0,30288,392,Double Simcoe IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,ChugsMugs,4.5," A- Poured with a mega head that dominated the glass before settling down to 2 fingers. Nice off white frothy head that left generous clumps of foam stuck to the edges. Golden brown color, nontransparent.		S- mm. sweet citrus, grapefruit most stinging in the nose. definetly some fresh cut pinebows or sawdust hidden in there. then brings you back to that grapefruit first noticed.		T- great bitterness right off the bat. a subtle flow of sweets just barely taking the edge off pure bitter annihilation. scents are backed up nicely with grapefruit tartness and that lingering pine. Mild soapyness maybe.		M- my personal favorite part of the beer. nice and thick. thoroughly coats the mouth with almost no carbonation. leaves behind its rich taste. 		D- This is one damn good Double IPA. Little room for improvement. Perfect abv to match taste and style, and such a rich flavor to keep it coming.",2009-10-07 00:54:14

8.0,52695,898,Heavy Seas - The Great Pumpkin,Pumpkin Ale,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,Jayli,3.5," Consumed 9/29/09	This beer pours a nice deep clear amber color with a one finger of off white sudsy head that recedes relatively quickly. Minimal spotty lacing left on the glass. Nose is spicey - nutmeg and cinnamon dominate, some pumpkin and malts filter in as well. Taste is similar to the other pumpkin ales that are heavy on the spice/pumpkin pie aspect, though this one seems a bit off balance. Spices seem to fight the pumpkin flavoring rather than compliment them. Cinnamon and nutmeg dominate the flavor with pumpkin and malts trying to fight through. Lighter side of medium bodied, mild carbonation, thick and chewy feel to the body. This was a decent brew, but I've had better offerings of the style.",2009-10-07 00:55:59
,53182,9790,Duck-Rabbit MÃ¤rzen,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,NCSUdo,4.0," 12 oz bottle		A: Pours a pretty clear dark amber/rusty copper, brown under a small white head. No lace, no retention.		S: Malt dominates, sweet, toasted some caramel and toffee. Put together well, but maybe could use a little ""oomph"".		T: Typical richness I associate with nearly all DR efforts. Sweet, toasted, caramel, toffee, very mild bitterness. Finish mostly toasted, with an ever so slight chocolate hint.		M/D: Mouthfeel keeps is good. Very good medium body, crisp to low carbonation. Slightly slick at times and ever so often, it feels a little thin, not sure if it's just my palate though. Drinkability is very good. A tasty beer, could use a little more in the aroma department, but very solid.",2009-10-07 00:56:04
6.0,33336,15280,Atwater Vanilla Java Porter,American Porter,3.0,3.5,4.0,2.5,batty,3.5," A: just on the brown side of black, just reddish-chocolatey at the edges when held to the light. off-white head is minimal, laces sticks for a little while, then disappears. i like my beers (esp porters i think) w/ big thick foam.. not quite up to what i was hoping.		S: mostly smells like vanilla extract, including the alcohol notes. label does say added vanilla extract, so makes sense, but doesn't explain the lack of much else - just a hint of chocolate really far under the surface, but really quite one-dimensional.		T: my first thought was of sweetness, then confusion, then of root beer. on closer inspection that first thought was rather ridiculous, and as i settle into the beer i get strong vanilla, but really of vanilla extract. tastes much more artificial than i would like, but this could be just because there isn't enough to back up the vanilla flavor - chocolatey malts, but really needs more body and substance in the middle for flavor to round out the brew		M: thin.		D: goes down pretty smooth and easy, and reasonably tasty.",2009-10-07 00:56:56
6.9,53169,211,Beejezus Hop Crisis BPA,American Pale Ale (APA),4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,Jayli,3.0," Consumed 10/1/09	This beer is actually listed as a ""Botanical Pale Ale."" 	Beer pours a relatively clear copper color with an offwhite head to it. Head recedes relatively quickly leaving wispy lacing on the glass. Nose is of pale malts, a good deal of honey, and major floral notes. Taste is very sweet up front, sugars and honey hit the tongue first, pale malts that seem somewhat bland hit the middle, and finishes with a huge floral burst - not a floral hop burst, I mean literally FLORAL taste to it. Lighter bodied, low carbonation, has a somewhat watery feel to it at first and a slick oily feel in the finish. This was definitely an interesting beer to try, I can honestly say I've not had anything even remotely like it and I applaud Watch City's efforts on this one - they definitely give something just a touch different here!",2009-10-07 00:58:02

The gentlest of pours coaxes a massive five finger head of rocky off white head. head exhibits tremendous staying power, however leaves no lace. Color is a wonderful clouded glowing orange with plenty of suspended sediment. 		Nose- Interesting. Mild lemon citrus with underlying medicinal notes. 		Pallate- Nice. Light lemon zest, heavy on the medicinal notes. Very subtle and pleasant. Some vanilla. Finish is very long with a nice moderate bitter bite. Moderately sweet.

8.0,14712,2681,Old Chub - Scottish Style Ale,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,JChurch,4.0," Poured from a 12oz can into a Dogfish pint.		The look is deep dark brown, with a reddish tint. A tan head forms but dissipates quickly with a fizzing sound, leaving a ring that eventually disappears altogether. No lacing to be found.		The smell is sweet and malty. I detect sugar, caramel, milk, baked beans, maple syrup, a slight sharpness like wine, alcohol comes through a bit.		The taste is big, sweet and malty. Brown sugar, caramel, a little toasty smokiness. As in the smell there is something vinous, especially when it is cold, in the back seat. This dwindles as it warms, leaving the malt monster to it's devices. It is very enjoyable, and more complex than I thought after the 1st one.		The feel is medium, with low carbonation. This is where I wanted more. The body was less full than the flavor, it did not match. As a whole, it was good, but I would prefer a bit more body and carbonation.		Great smell and taste, not too heavy despite the full flavors, and the alcohol is very well concealed. Drinkable, but dangerously so.",2009-10-07 00:59:37

S - Funk, bready yeastiness, and sweetness from the blonde it was blended with.		T - It gets pretty interesting here. Starts with sour and vinegar that evolves into a dry sweet taste that stays with you for a second. Definitely not like any other beer I've had before. It gets a lot better as it reaches room temperature as well.		M/D - What an awesome blended beer. Incredably drinkable for a 10.5abv ""sour"", much more than a bottle of Vin De Cereale. The lambic blends perfectly with the blond creating something that I wish I bought more of!",2009-10-07 01:00:04

The problem is that somehow the overall taste is weak/watery compared to other imperial styles. Maybe Mark forgot about the water content in fresh hops, who knows?		M: As mentioned before, too clean at the finish to be considered a heavier beer. The medium carbonation doesn't help ether.		D: Could have a few more if it wasn't as expensive, but definitely not up to the hype. Perhaps Sweetwater should focus more on the beer instead of crazy names.",2009-10-07 01:00:20
7.5,38180,2210,Union Jack India Pale Ale,American IPA,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,GJ40,4.0," Sampled from a 22oz bottle purchased at Whole Foods on Westlake in Seattle. No date on the bottle.		A golden ale with the slightest haze and a small white head. Aroma is piney and citrusy hops with a touch of toasted malt and yeast. Starts with a nice citrusy bitterness but then switches to a malty and yeasty flavor. The bitterness picks up over time and the malt continues to provide a nice foundation. There's good lacing left on the glass as it empties. The consistency is moderate with a low carbonation. 		I'd been meaning to try this and after I heard it won best IPA at GABF, I figured it was time. I think it's a balanced and enjoyable IPA but I wouldn't put it in the top three.",2009-10-07 01:00:27
4.0,23261,11212,Rodeo Extra Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,RedDiamond,3.5," Iron Horse's website lists Rodeo at 4% ABV, while the house menu at their tasting room has it at 5%. It is a gently clouded brassy ale served with a smart soapy head after an initial surge of foam filled the glass. A vague aroma emulates the citric taste that leans more towards mandarin orange than typical lemon or grapefruit qualities. This draws to a tart finish on a fairly thin body. Routine.",2009-10-07 01:01:35
5.7,26091,112,Old Plowshare Stout,American Stout,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,natelocc787,4.0," This beer was better than I expected. Chocolate and black coffee flavors with a creamy vanilla character. The smell was of black coffee and roasted chocolate malt. Taste was the same+the vanilla. Mouthfeel was good but not great, a little thin. Upon finishing the first bottle I thought this was a very fine example. Upon remembering the Rogue Shakespeare is the same style and roughly same ABV I realized this wasn't so great after all. Still a good session beer and well crafted quality.",2009-10-07 01:01:45
4.5,53158,765,Trafalgar Malted Corpse,Irish Red Ale,3.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,Viggo,2.0," 650 ml bottle from the LCBO. These new labels are abysmal.		Pours a clear dark red, some brownish highlights, pretty thick and foamy light tan head forms, quickly settles down to a thin ring around the glass, no lace spots. Smell is very sweet and malty, caramel, some bread, dark fruit, almost a bit of spiciness, cherries and strawberries, a bit medicinal, brown sugar, not good but not as bad as most Trafalgar. Taste is very weak in the flavour, some brown sugar and a bit of caramel, very bready, weird kind of rotten fruit flavour, some spice, almost a banana flavour, but very watery, almost nothing there. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, almost feels a bit syrupy, low to medium carbonation, not awful but certainly not good at all, pretty tough to drink. Not a whole lot of incentive to finish this bottle.",2009-10-07 01:01:55

8.25,53042,13837,Satisfaction Jacksin,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,Ek0nomik,3.0," Poured In: Tulip Glass	Purchased At: Steve's Liquor (Madison, WI)		I'm a big fan of Ale Asylum. Hopalicious is an incredible beer and Ballistic was on its tail. When I heard about an IIPA from Ale Asylum my eyes lit up.		Appearance: Pours a very deep fire hued amber color. It looks rather similar to Surly Furious. A finger of head sits at the top of my glass, but it dissipates pretty quickly. A few sheets of lacing at the top of the glass.		Smell: As soon as I cracked open the bottle I took a whiff. The centennial hops poured out. I poured it into my tulip glass and started jotting down my appearance notes. I came back to the smell, and took a whiff. The hops seem to have left my glass. Well, not entirely, but it's no longer overwhelming which I would suspect from an IIPA. It's a fight between sweet malt and citrus hops, but I wish it was a little more one sided.		Taste: I must be crazy, right? An IIPA but Ale Asylum, and it's not living up to the expectations of an IIPA. The taste unveils, as the nose did, a fight between malt and hops. The malt tastes sweet and bread-like. The hops are citrus, wielding notes of grapefruit and orange peel. It leaves a bitter aftertaste, but nothing out of line. Some hop oils are coating my teeth, gums and tongue. The aftertaste is more grapefruit from those centennial hops. The slightly high ABV is well hidden.		Mouthfeel: The beer hits the tongue unleashing a crisp kick of carbonation. A medium bodied beer, presenting just a dab of chewiness.		Drinkability: A bit of a let down to be honest. I'd take a Hopalicious over this any day. Sure, I know Hopalicious is categorized as an APA, but it's far from it. It's definitely an IPA, and it has the hop character to be an IIPA, but not the malt characteristics. This is a good beer, but I wouldn't pick this up again. There are better IIPA's available around Wisconsin to make this take a back seat. And given the price of this, it wouldn't end up in my crate again, even if it became a regular offering. I still love Ale Asylum though.",2009-10-07 01:03:16
6.9,16403,141,"Smuttynose IPA ""Finest Kind""",American IPA,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,woosterbill,4.0," 12 oz bottle, best by 2/10, into a Duvel tulip.		A: Pours a hazy orange-tinted amber; 3/4"" frothy head subsides fairly quickly, leaving a good amount of feathery lace. Solid-looking beer.		S: Surprisingly understated aroma of juicy, citrusy hops; a little bit of bready malt. Honestly, there's not much to talk about here; pretty disappointing.		T: Bready malt up front, followed by overwhelming piney hop bitterness. As it warms, a little bit of malt sweetness shows up near the finish. Not bad, but nothing special.		M: Medium-to-full-bodied with light carbonation. A little sticky. 		D: The bitterness of this beer comes without much of a payoff in the complexity department, so it doesn't really leave me intrigued enough to kill for another sip. Does a good job hiding the substantial ABV, though.		Notes: I've had more than a few Finestkinds over the last few months, and I'm always satisfied - and always a little disappointed. Smutty makes a lot of beers that I really love, and I just want to love their IPA as well. Sadly, I can never really sink into this beer. Ah, well; maybe next time.		Cheers!",2009-10-07 01:04:17
6.7,6549,140,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop Ale,American IPA,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,brewandbbq,4.0," 24oz bottle from the fridge. 13th release of the Harvest Wet Hop Ale. Submitted here under the 12th release rather than adding a separate entry for an identical beer. $5.95 from Bert's Better Beers.		Pours clear copper with a half inch head of off white. A mostly solid skim coat remained on the surface for the duration of the glass, as well as plenty of streaks and dots of lacing.		Aromatics lead off with plenty of citrus-laden, piney, dank, resinous hops. Herbage aplenty with undertones of moss, kindbud, cut grass, and spruce bark. A clean, crisp malt foundation steps forward along with plenty of pungent, floral hoppage. Hints of toasted biscuits and candied resin follow through.		Medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel and a slight chew.		Juicy, resinous hops start the palate with plump malt underneath. A firm, drying bitterness in tandem with plenty of citrus, pine, and mossy vines. Warming alcohol, but barely.		Finishes with a lingering, smooth bitterness, skunky resins, and sweetish malt.		Yum, so tasty and fresh. A side by side with the Estate showed the Harvest to be a shade hoppier, as well as the added dank, resinous note from the wet hops. Otherwise the two beers are pretty identical. I prefer the Harvest though over the Estate.",2009-10-07 01:06:35
5.2,10705,2171,Oatmeal Stout,Oatmeal Stout,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,humuluslupulus8,4.5," A: The beer was a very dark brown color, almost black. It looked transparent, and there were practically no carbonation bubbles rising inside the glass. The head was thick and cream-like in appearance with a light tan color; it left plenty of lacing on the glass.		S: I mostly smelled coffee and bitter chocolate with a little bit of yeast. 		T: The beer tasted very similar to how it smelled. The coffee flavor was strongest, and a bitter, dark chocolate flavor was also present. I did not taste hops or alcohol too much.		M: This was the one of the smoothest beer I've tasted, and it felt thicker than other beers I've drank. There was very little carbonation.		D: Overall, this beer was very tasty, and I would recommend it to others; especially those who like dark beers. I agree with other reviewers that this is more of a dessert beer, and it could easily be the dessert after a meal. This beer reminds me of 1554 by New Belguim, but I like the oatmeal stout better.",2009-10-07 01:06:47
8.0,25435,26,Moloko,Milk / Sweet Stout,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,Ezekiel81923,4.5," 22oz bomber via trade. Thank you kindly alleykatking! Pouring this into my Troegs pint glass.		Appearance: Pure black. Pours very thick. Very thin head sitting on top of the brew that thins out even further to almost no head at all. Minimal lacing. Looks tasty though.		Smell: Typical stout aroma's of coffee, chocolate, caramel and roasted malts. Sugary sweetness most likely a characteristic of the lactose sugar.		Taste: Not an overwhelming chocolate/coffee/roasted flavor which I like. Not much hop balance but it still finishes with a sweet, milky flavor that seems to give way to another round of coffee flavors at the last second. An interesting stout. 		Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy, sweet. Just slides down your throat.		Drinkability: High. Quite high. I finished this alarmingly quickly. If you're still on the fence about stouts, drink this one. It will change your mind. It's that good.		Damn FFF for not distributing in Philly...bring it back!",2009-10-07 01:07:33
5.1,1949,211,Clocktoberfest Lager,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,Jayli,4.0," consumed 10/1/09	This beer poured a somewhat hazy deeper copper color, with about a one finger of offwhite head to it. Head recedes to a film and left nice thick streaks of lacing on the glass. Nose is of caramelized malts, touch of sugar, touch of grassiness, and a biscuity background. Taste falls very much in line with the nose thought it is a bit more sweet than the smell let on, but still has has nuttiness, toasted bread, and some caramel with a large backing of sweetness. Lighter side of medium bodied, medium carbonation, crisp and clean on the tongue. This is by and far my favorite Oktoberfest thusfar.",2009-10-07 01:08:02
5.1,37400,113,Samuel Smith's Organic Cherry Fruit Beer,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.0,3.5,2.5,2.0,hustlesworth,3.0," A- dense pink tinted foam sits atop an almost vermilion colored slightly hazy brew, and the suds settle fast to a thin sheen surrounded by a nice soapy ring. some sheets of lace stick after i drink.		S- tart cherry sourness makes my face tingle. also some cherry candy and cough drop aroma in there as well. a faint undertone of toasty malt and nothing is evident beyond that. 		T- very flavorful to say the least, the cherry is powerful and dominant, on both sweet and sour sides of the spectrum. perhaps this brew was blended to be as mild as possible to allow for a more intense cherry flavor. beer flavor is there... somewhere, in the far distance, somewhere over yonder, but the more sips i take the more it seems like cherry juice and soda water. only the slightest sense of malt is perceived, and very very soft earthy bitterness in the cherry cherry finish. 		MF- juicy, cloying, and medicinal, makes me feel sugary and sickly. don't like it. 		D- samuel smiths is definitely one of my favorite breweries but this is not the beer for me. i feel terrible giving such a low rating, but it must be done. there is so damn much cherry that the beer cannot even compete and it gets a little overwhelming for my taste in a beer of this nature.",2009-10-07 01:08:46
10.5,44932,16866,Autumn Maple,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,Gmann,4.0," Out of a 750 ml capped bottle. Pours light chocolate brown color with honey highlights; a rather small tan head that quickly settled into nothingness. The aroma is of nice spicy belgian yeast; banana and clove, brown sugar, and figs. The maple aroma comes through as the brew warms. The taste is vinous, a plum fruitiness, an earthy spice tone, light lemon tartness. The molasses and maple syrup add the sweetness to the brew but are fairly subtle and blend with what I imagine is the yam. Not much yam flavor but I pick it up towards the end. The feel is moderate to thick, perhaps a touch syrupy and sticky; light carbonation and quite noticable abv. An interesting brew, needs to tone down the booze so that the other flavors come through. Perhaps some aging would do the trick.",2009-10-07 01:09:12
16.8,28204,30,Mephistopheles' Stout,American Double / Imperial Stout,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,ThreeWiseMen,4.0," Batch 4 bottle (dated November 2008) poured into a Rmy Martin snifter.		Appearance: Wow, that is thick! And opaque. It looks like dark matter (you know, from outer space), and feels like lead. No joke. A dark brown foamy head crawled up to the surface shortly after the pour, and then sizzled its way down to a creamy halo. Beer leaves an oily film on the walls of the glass along with spotty lacing.		Smell: Burnt sugar, roasted malt, sweet wood - hickory?, red berries, chocolate creme, and just plain old grains. Alcohol is masked extremely well. I'm impressed.		Taste: Very roasty and very sweet. The finish is quite dry and alcoholic, but it's not nearly as bad as I expected. Once again, this beer masks the alcohol pretty well. As for the flavor profile, I get molasses and roasted malt, followed by charred wood, spicy hops, and alcohol. Nicely done.		Mouthfeel: Syrupy, sugary, prickly, heavy, and warm. A true sipper. Finishes very dry with a touch of smoke and lingers for a long time.		Drinkability: For such a big beer, this is damn drinkable! I sat around for a long time watching baseball and doing homework as my buzz slowly built. This is a very well-crafted big beer that I'll likely be buying again.",2009-10-07 01:10:08
6.0,51816,14319,La BiÃ¨re Du Plateau,American Stout,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,MeisterBurger,3.0," Pours a very dark cola color with a white head that dissipates quickly leaving only a sparse ring of head at the periphery of the glass.		The aroma is roast and a sour cabbage or corn vegetal, just a light smattering of chocolate and coffee. 		The taste is bready and only slightly roastiness, with some light chocolate, and a fairly dry finish. Astringent, slightly mouth puckering at first, and cooked vegetable taste to it. The finish is very quick on this.		The mouthfeel is a little thin and light.		I assume that ""Noire au caf espresso"" means ""Dark coffee espresso"" and that it is brewed with coffee beans of some sort, but I would have guessed any coffee like qualities this has were from the malt, not from coffee, because it's pretty subtle. This is no Peche Mortel, that's for sure.",2009-10-07 01:12:41
6.4,36341,1683,State Pen Porter,American Porter,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.0,tempest,3.5," From the bottle, it poured near black with a short tan head. I found this beer to be a typically tasty and standard American porter. Drinkable and full of dark roast coffee, cocoa, and burnt grain. The body is lighter than most, but that just makes this a good candidate for a session beer. There's nothing terribly outstanding or different, but it's a clean, solid beer.",2009-10-07 01:14:53
5.0,26142,787,Irish Stout,Irish Dry Stout,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,ChopperSmith,4.0," Poured from the tap at the South Shore brewery. Called ""Irish Milk Stout"" on the beer board on the wall.		Appearance: Dark black with a creamy off-white head. Long retention on the nitro-tap head.		Smell: Malty and caramel sweetness.		Taste: A very tasty stout. Fresh, creamy and easy drinking. Matly goodness with complex flavors of burnt caramel, coffee and a hint of black licorice, but nothing overpowering. One of the best Irish Stout's I've had outside of Ireland, and on par with a good fresh Guinness in Ireland (and I've had a few at the Guinness brewery in Dublin).		Mouth Feel: Very creamy, smooth and drinkable. 		Drinkability: Very drinkable. I could easily see doing a few of these in a session. I was just there for lunch, so I wanted to try something else.",2009-10-07 01:15:12
7.4,4629,26,Rabbid Rabbit,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,Ezekiel81923,4.5," 22oz bomber via trade thanks to Alleykatking. Poured into my Weyerbacher pint glass.		Appearance: Hazy. Sort of a macro look to it as it has the same kind of piss yellow color to it. Head builds up but disappears in a flash. Not much retention to speak of. Hey, as long as it tastes good.		Smell: Very spicy. Clove. Not quite the same kind of spice you find in other saisons though, this smells a little sweeter, or fuller, or both. Found some hops in there as well.		Taste: Whoa. Weird. But fantastic. Some clove and yeast flavors in there, but the presence of the rock candy the labels indicates was used in the brewing process is certainly there. And it's executed brilliantly. Not too strong or sweet, just enough. Some hop presence is there, but not enough to detract from the rock candy.		Mouthfeel: I want to say it was lighter than I expected given its flavor, but I want to say it was just right given the appearance. Feels a little spritzy on the tongue. Real nice.		Drinkability: I know this is supposedly 9% but...no. No it's not. It can't be. This drinks just like the most sessionable of beers. I could drink this all day if not for the fear of alcohol poisoning. 		I gave this high marks in the taste category based on its uniqueness alone, but in reality, this is probably one of the best saison's I've had anyway.",2009-10-07 01:16:02

Nice black beer with a dark brown head. 1 finger to the head and the appearance of this beer after poured reminded me of a breakfast stout. Nice cascading effect as the snifter is tilted. Roasted malt with burnt brown sugar and semi-sweet chocolate. Slightly smoky as it comes in and slightly sweet as it goes down. Mouthfeel a little on the silky, thin side.

7.3,22505,2743,Green Flash West Coast I.P.A.,American IPA,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,jrallen34,3.5," I drank this from the bottle into a chalice.		It pours a medium orange with big white head, lots of retention and good lacing. This beer is pretty clear and has lots of carbonation. 		The aroma is very strong, equal smells or strong orange peel and hops.		The tastse is much bitter than it smells and almost comes as shock. The taste lasts several seconds and bitterness makes it hard to drink a ton of it.",2009-10-07 01:18:57
9.5,50795,147,Stone 13th Anniversary Ale,American Strong Ale,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,Reaper16,4.5," 22oz. bomber served into a Chimay goblet.	Thanks, BdubleEdubleRUN!		Pours a chestnut brown with reddish edges, but looks considerably lighter & more red when held directly to light. An aggressive pour yielded a large head (for this glassware type anyway) of one and a half fingers. The lacing is rocky, though sporadic, and quite pretty in its creamy, off-white shade.		The bottle says to consume in 2009 because of its hop content, and even though I'm cutting it fairly close the hop character has not died in the nose. Lots of appetizing grapefruit and pine -- those hallmark aromas that draws the hophead in like a dope fiend going into vacant houses in the morning to get his blast. Granny Smith apple is noticeable as well, its tart quality very inviting. The malts smell deep and rich and bring the promise of big flavor. There is some kind of burnt or charred scent somewhere in this. Wood, I'm guessing; some kind of barrel. I kept expecting to get alcohol fusels but the booze is remarkably well-hidden in the nose. A nice blend of aromas that work together.		At the beginning of each sip/drink/gulp the taste is strong ale all the way: malted flavors, caramel malt, silky texture. Then it starts to get interesting. One reviewer mentioned pilsner malt, and I have to say that I get that as well. That lightness works well with the hop blast that develops all-of-a-sudden, as if a bomb went off in your mouth. Its GOOD hop flavor, too, coming close to the deep pine of Pliny the Elder. All those resiny, bitter, leafy flavors develop dead-center on the tongue and pulsate at the back of the mouth after the swallow. Its particularly delicious for 10 seconds or so, until the flavor weakens to a disappointing aftertaste of grainy malt and astringent bitterness. A most curious strong ale indeed, one with complexity and surprise. 		The mouthfeel is okay. The beer is trying to toe the line between syrupy strong ale and punishingly hoppy DIPA (a line that Stone has created in the first place with the Bastard series and now this beer). I'm not convinced that it succeeds in feeling like that balance, but the higher level of carbonation helps to cover up some sins. Its pretty good in the drinkability department for what it is. Its bitter, and contains a lot of alcohol; the one bomber is enough.		This is a damn good beer in my book. The hop flavors are nicely-realized and delicious. Once the hops kick in you kind of forget about the malt, which is certainly a detriment. I nearly scored the taste category lower because of this, but I couldn't deny that I enjoyed drinking 13th Anniversary. For hopheads, this will do very nicely while also providing a change of pace from the usual.",2009-10-07 01:19:13
6.7,2565,590,Uff-da,Bock,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.5,taylorhamrick,3.5," Pours a very dark brown, a deep beautiful dark brown, with a nice 2cm head, but the bubbles are loose and falls down, leaving only a little bit of lacing. The beer is fairly clear, if you can see through the darkness. The smell is incredibly sweet and nutty, like toffee, raisins, thick heavy caramellized syrup - reminds me a bit more of like an english barleywine, or a more cleanly fermented dark belgian. I wish it was maybe a bit less on the toffee, almost buttery taste, a bit cleaner, with some real graininess - I expected more graininess, a little bit of toastiness, but I'd say that the sweetness is ok. I don't know if the grains are right in this, or maybe by experience with bocks has just been a bit confused. The taste is good. Very bready, and quite grainy, very sticky, some of the nice qualities of a bock, but still too raisiny and toffee-y for a bock, it's like a delicious blend of belgian, german, and british, to be honest, but it says right there on the bottle ""Uff-Da"" (which I recently learned from someone is Norwegian, so out goes the German implications there - thanks weatyweiss) with a neck label that says ""Bock"", should be fully german, and I don't know if it is. Maybe if some of the caramel malt was replaced with chocolate malt (and maybe some pale malt to balance out the color) this would be a bit better, though honestly I don't dislike it. The body is good, nice and thick, very sticky, with a nice light carbonation, nothing sharp, very good there. This is definitely a slow drinkier. If I step back and drink this, without knowing what style it's supposed to be, I woudl actually like it. It's like a cold-fermented belgian style to me (just think of it without quite the same yeast profile). The ABV is a little high, but I expected it. I'm going to give this a kind of higher drinkability (and some higher things because it's pretty good, it's just that it doesn't seem exactly right for a bock).",2009-10-07 01:19:22
6.0,9539,4288,Pelican Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,DoubleJ,3.5," On-tap at NBBC last night, on to the beer:		Shiny copper color leaving thin rings of lacing to the glass. The aroma and flavor are akin to your classic APA. Diacetyl and a mild grapefuirt hoppiness mix to give this beer the aroma it has, and much of the flavor too. A breath of biscuit malt sticks around in the aftertaste with the husky grapefruit. A shade thinner than I'd like in feel, but overall, this is a solid brewpub pale ale.",2009-10-07 01:19:46
9.0,41472,15642,Winter Warlock,English Barleywine,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,gford217,3.0," 750mL bottle courtesy of Maximum12 poured into a tulip. The ABV is listed as 10.1% on this bottle FWIW.		The pour is much lighter than I was expecting, a clear golden amber with an enormous fluffy white head that recedes very slowly, leaving very good lacing. It's a great looking beer, but certainly not what I was expecting.		The aroma continues with the theme of unexpected and has a very light fruity aroma with only a little bit of caramel malts. Some sweet sugars, toasted grains and hops round things out. Not too impressed with the aroma.		The flavor is light with lots of sugar and toasted grains. Again, not much in the way of caramel malts or dark fruits. I get a little bit of light fruits, maybe peaches. It's a weird flavor to get from a ""barleywine.""		The mouthfeel is medium bodied and almost syrupy with the massive sugar presence. Sticky.		This is one of the weirdest barleywines I've ever tasted. In fairness, it would make for a decent golden Belgian ale. Even then, it's a fairly unimpressive beer with very little complexity underneath the heavy sugar presence.",2009-10-07 01:19:52
9.0,52248,139,Shipyard Smashed Pumpkin (Pugsley's Signature Series),Pumpkin Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,Stringth,4.5," Had it a few weeks ago at the Shipyard in Eliot. Golden, a tad darker than a pilsner, a muted but interesting smell, DID NOT get any of the typical pumpkin pie tastes or smells like everyone else did (huh?). I think my taste buds were functioning, weird.		The first thing I noticed and then celebrated was that the usual Shipyard bast of ringwood yeast taste was no where to be found, thank you Lord, thank you Jesus. I remember it tasting good--complex enough yet refreshing and really working to discern any pumpkin flavor. They better have some left!",2009-10-07 01:19:57

Bomber poured into an over sized wine glass. Appearance is a nice orange/copper color with a big 2 finger chunky white head. Big sticky lacing on the glass. Nice smell mainly of orange, mango, a lot of citrus. Taste is full of hops and orange with a very bitter/hop forward finish. I like the bitterness but I can see how some people would not. Not much malt balance at all in this brew. Mouthfeel is nice with a good bit of carbonation. Nice hop burps only 1/2 way through the bomber. I thinks its very drinkable and i blew through this bomber no problem. Again, I don't think the bitterness is for everyone but I really liked it. I think it was just as good or slightly better than the original little sumpin'. This one is a winner in my book, well done Lagunitas. I think I will need to grab another bomber of this while its still around. Recommended for sure to hopheads.",2009-10-07 01:21:05

Appearance: A clear deep golden almost brown color. Good carbonation with a soap bubble white head that didn't last long but laced nicely.		Smell: Floral hops with some nice roasted malts underneath.		Taste: Hops up front with a grapefruit-like citrus flavor, followed by sweeter roasted malts and a touch of hops bitterness on the tongue. Very nice balance of flavors.		Mouth Feel: Crisp, dry and good carbonation.		Drinkability: Very drinkable. Could easily do a session with this...and I will, I grabbed a growler to go (along with a growler of the ""Honey Pilsner"", which I have yet to try).",2009-10-07 01:22:52
8.5,52828,147,Kona Coffee Macadamia Coconut Porter,American Porter,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,bmanning,4.5," Pours a viscous black with thin tan head.	Smell is mostly coffee and bakers chocolate with some vanilla and cherry.	Taste is amazing - this beer has such complexity! There is milk chocolate up front with coffee, dark fruits, coconut, leather, toffee, tobacco, cherry, vanilla, and almond. This beer is so much like a light version of a Dark Lord with all the great flavors blending so well together. Not nearly as thick as a Dark Lord though. I really like how the coconut and macadamia nut play into the flavors of this beer.	Overall this beer is fantastic - easily the best of the Stone collaboration beers.

8.5,46333,877,Hop-a-lot-amus,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,indiapaleale,4.5," Pour - Hop-a-lot-amus pours a hazy, orangish amber color with a fluffy head that quickly fades and sinks back into the mire from which it came.		Aroma - Pine, citrus, sweet oranges, hops, hops and more hops. Smells like a potent hop cocktail.		Taste - Wow. This is the real deal. Super piney, citrusy, resiny and oh so hoppy. It numbs the tongue and tingles the teeth. All of the great flavors of an intensely hoppy IPA are there. One sip deserves another and another. Its made me warm and my hop sensors have overloaded. Thankfully there is enough sweet maltiness to tame this Hop-a-lot-amus and make sure it has an even temperament. We wouldn't it to become angry!		Overall - Seriously hoppy and seriously unfiltered, love it. Very drinkable and well balanced. I've tangled with the Hop-a-lot-amus and I am happy to say we are now friends.		Would I buy more of it? Of course. Its big, its hoppy and its delicious. It comes in a convenient four-pack as well.",2009-10-07 01:23:53
6.3,52795,20417,White Birch Saison,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,IBUnit63,4.0," If we're counting...Batch 4, 14/108. Nice pop and pffft of the oxygen-encapsulating cap. A little wavy funk off the top. Into a Duvel tulip...		It has a cloudiness to it as well as a full-finger-and-then-some pure white, meringue-blue head. Lacing is decent, as is retention.		A little iffiness on the nose at first; it's almost a note of feta cheese with a spent charcoal tone that obscure the solid yeast and light grain electricity. It's a bit on the weird side at first, but the good side is that there's definitely a bit of expected funkiness. The components of a traditional Saison are there; although the feta/charcoal dust is a bit off-putting in the beginning, I expect that it won't be an issue anywhere else. (edit) It takes a while...almost an hour...but now we're dealing with a little bit of solid Saison funkiness. NOW we're cooking with gas...		As expected, this deal is back on the game. Nice, dry and tight yeast and raw grain electricity. A bit of nice hop pine. Underlying barnyard notes work better on the taste buds than on the nose. It's dry, well-carbonated and rustic...a bit of unevenness adds to the character of the style. Well-carbonated and a bit spritely.		Once the scent dissipates it's a lighter Saison in body but a heavier one as far as palate notes go. Finish is carbonated and funky; there may be something different brewing here that keeps it a little left of clean.		This one starts clearing up after a while to serve up a solid Saison. Definitely more funky than the average bear; partly it seems by intention; a little bit seems to provide a smidge of weirdness. I'm missing the intended spice and fruitiness on the front end, yet the yeastiness indicates that it may be what we expect. A little spice on the nose and palate indicate more promise as it warms and warms. Definitely a rustic Saison that can be appreciated.",2009-10-07 01:24:48
6.6,44894,16261,Pumpkin Ale,Pumpkin Ale,4.0,4.5,3.5,3.5,BeerPhan86,4.5," I live in Upstate NY and had never even heard of this NY brewery until today. Decided to give the Pumpkin Ale a shot, which not many seem to have tried but apparently has been well received by those who have.		A - Light golden body with a one finger white foamy head that persists. Seems to be plenty of carbonation rising in the glass. 		S - Spices and pumpkin (good thing to smell, most pumpkin ales are simply spicy brown ales). There is also a nice malty/biscuity backbone. Already I can smell some cinnamon and brown sugar. The sweetness and spices come through very well especially after the first sip. 		T - Wow, this is unlike any other pumpkin ale I've had. The closest thing to it is the Southern Tier Pumking and it is still very different. Pumpkin, spice, very sweet tasting with a nice almost burning bite to it. I like that it has that squash taste to it that most pumpkin ales lack. There is definitely a cinnamon and brown sugar taste going on here, and it tends to lean towards the spices, but still balances well with a nice bready malt backbone and true pumpkin flavor. They are infusing that buttery pie crust flavor in the finish that Southern Tier Pumking pulls off, which I am VERY impressed by. 		M - Smooth silky mouthfeel but the overcarbonation is a bit much. If they toned down the carbonation this would be perfect. 		D - A very nice treat but I can't even tell the ABV on this one (it puts on quite a buzz even after a couple of sips so I imagine it is 8-10%). It is extremely flavorful so I would probably not session this one. It seems like a more imperial style pumpkin ale than your average pumpkin ale, but I guess we won't know until there is an ABV reading. The 22oz does just fine!		Overall, a very nice change of pace in the onslaught of pumpkin ales this season. Definitely seems to be more of an imperial style and the closest thing to it (and still my favorite) is the ST Pumking, but this is completely unique in its own right. I should have grabbed more! Definitely recommended from this pumpkin ale fanatic.",2009-10-07 01:26:28
,25176,4288,Wedge Weizen,Hefeweizen,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.5,DoubleJ,3.0," On-tap at NBBC last night, on to the beer:		Slightly hazy wheat field blonde in appearance, not quite as cloudy as I'd expect. What malt and a kiss of hops greet the nose, no banana, no spice, nuttin. The flavor is a bit more interesting. There is a hint of bubblegum at first, then a watery banana flavor debuts. A little peppery bitterness adds the ""spice"" to the beer. It's feel is the best part of the beer, as it is soft and creamy. It's a pretty good wheat ale, but as an ""authentic hefeweizen"", it needs more character.",2009-10-07 01:27:44
8.0,3158,610,Hop Rod Rye,Rye Beer,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,bkett01,4.5," Enjoyed from the tap at the Bear Republic Brewpub in downtown Healdsburg this morning. Hey, it was afternoon on the east coast.		Appearance is a dark amber topped with a one finger creamy head which dissipated after a few minutes. Smell is slightly bready with a big dose of hops. 		Taste is pine and grapefruit over a semi-sweet malty backbone that the rye helps make stand up to the hops. Still loses the battle, but it's nice for balance. Well carbonated, this stays lively as you drink it and is drinkable other than the ABV. 		Overall, a great rye IPA. A style that I wish more breweries took a shot at. Highly enjoyable & recommended.",2009-10-07 01:28:17
6.0,53184,11212,Biere De Garde,BiÃ¨re de Garde,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,RedDiamond,3.5," Given the abundance of saisons in our region (including Iron Horse's own), it's odd that we don't see many biere de gardes, as the two styles are closely related. Iron Horse's version is tawny-auburn with a soft carpet of foam, and simple sugar aroma. The flavor is both dry and fruity with notes of cherry and strawberry and a slight touch of pencil shaving in the finish. Harsh alcohol contours are momentarily expressed, but the beer warms well and its soft texture enhances drinkability.",2009-10-07 01:28:59

S - A slight sweet malt aroma followed by a powerful dose of hops that is above most pale ales but slightly below most IPAs. Quite enjoyable and fresh smelling.		T - Malty backbone with a spicy hop bite that continues towards the aftertaste. Far hoppier than most English Pale's I've had. I would call this closer to an APA. Very enjoyable however.		M/D - Mouthfeel is about dead on for a good session beer, and this is about as much of an easy drinker as you can get.",2009-10-07 01:29:21

Pours dark brown with a small head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are light and I can make out hints of coffee and vanilla. Taste is sourish. Mouthfeel is watery.

Big nose. Chocolate, roast malt, raspberry, cherry, and molasses all present.		Hits with chocolate sweetness and roast flavor. Finishes tart with a very nice hop presence.

12.0,17538,1199,Founders Devil Dancer,American Double / Imperial IPA,5.0,4.5,5.0,4.5,jbhuxley,5.0," This is the last survivor of the 4 pack that I purchased in July. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Bottled on 6/17/09.		Pours hazy, brilliant ruby copper in color, with one finger of smooth cream colored head. Retention is good, subsiding to a ring after the first couple of sips. Leaves behind a solid sticky but runny coat of lacing.		Smells strongly of grapefruit citrus hops with a malty, honey/toffee aroma. Alcohol presence is also very noticeable. As the beer warms up a bit, some dark fruit scents begin to come out. 		There's a blast of earthy, grassy hops right from the start. The malt is packed full of brown sugar flavors, but not overly sweet. The alcohol warms on its way down. 		There is less of a fruity hop presence than I remember from drinking this beer back in July and August. I would have loved to save this beer for longer, but I didn't want to kill the hoppiness. I am however, getting much more of a toffee presence than I remember from drinking this beer in the past. 		Mouthfeel is not overly thick but still a bit sticky. The alcohol is not so much noticeable in the taste, just in the warming as it goes down. This beer is exceptionally drinkable, considering the ABV and the IBUs listed on the bottle.",2009-10-07 01:29:47
9.5,1558,26,Dreadnaught IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,jackorain,4.5," Pours a golden copper color with a slight haze. The stark white dense head stays around for a very long time and leaves an incredible amount of think lace and a thick coat.		The aroma is a wonderful mingling of pine and grapefruit hops, tangerine and caramel sweetness. 		The hop flavor of grapefruit, oranges, tangerine and pine all come roaring in with the first sip. This is followed a big sweetness of caramel and simple syrup. Middle to end brings a big bitter hit that lingers through to the finis and further. Subsequent sips bring more depth of grapefruit, pink, white and ruby red juice. The pine also emerges in the finish. Tropical fruit also begins to emerge as the beer warms up.		Medium body with vibrant carbonation. The bubbles carry the bitterness to the hard palate and the back of the mouth. The hop oils coat the mouth as well.		Overall, this is one fine beer. One of the best double IPAs I have had.",2009-10-07 01:29:57
8.0,46986,7730,TyttebÃ¦r,American Wild Ale,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,jamie2dope,4.0," A wild ale brewed with mountain cranberries? That gets my Attention right away. I bought it at Liquor World for $12.75. The foam rose straight to the top of bottle as soon as I popped the cap, but luckily not quickly enough to cause a spill. Color is a mixture of blond and red, and heading is white. Nose gives off an interesting fruit note, certainly not the type of cranberries I am used to. It definitely smells wild too. The flavor is tart, but not overpowering by any means, and the basement/funk tastes I get work very well along with the fruit. The fruit, itself reminds me somewhat of gooseberries, which I only had the chance to try very recently. Body is light, but some degree of alcohol can be felt in the flavor, and by it's warming effect. This site says the ABV is around four percent whereas the bottle I am looking at says it is eight percent. I would have to agree with the bottle in this case. One thing I have to mention is that as this review has gone on, I have upped some of the scores compared to my initial reactions. This beer is growing on me with every sip, and would make a nice accompaniment to many fruit based desserts. I was not sure about going for this when I saw the price tag, but at this point I would say that it was a very good decision. It definitely ranks well within the world of wild and extreme beers.

9.2,24071,68,Gonzo Imperial Porter,Baltic Porter,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,mdwalsh,3.5," A: Black, even when held up to the sun. Dark brown head that doesn't stay around long at all but around the edges leaves some good lacing. The bubbles that are there are large. 4		S: Burnt sugar? Very malty, but I can detect a little bit of hops in there somewhere. Reminds me of an Imperial Stout more than a porter. Really fills the air though. 4		T: A little boozy, and still tastes sweet burnt. It reminds me a little of when you get a bit of charred wood on a marshmellow while camping. Not much complexity in the flavor at all I think. Those hops from the nose are gone. 3		M: Slippery. Thick up front, but finishes thin, very odd. refreshing though. 4		D: Meh, I don't think I'll get any more of this, though it does get a good buzz going. 3		Take two. I've let the beer age a little and my palate has matured. The scores are from my second try.		A: Pours black as black as black can be with a brown head of small, stiff bubbles. I get absolutely no light coming through. Really good looking.		S: Dark, sweet candied fruit. MMM, no hops that I can tell, unless, well, maybe some background English or something for bittering, but it's pretty mellowed out now. A little bit of roast, but mostly cloying smelling.		T: Bittersweet. Tastes more charred than the smell, like charred barbecue sauce or something. But after a few sips, that's not nearly as harsh. Now the beer is almost getting bland. I'm still getting a little roastyness, but also straight forward sweetness. No hops.		M: Lighter than I wanted, really. And leaves me feeling a little dry really.		D: Other than that initial bittersweet kick in the teeth, this is pretty drinkable. I like it. I would consider buying more.",2009-10-07 01:30:09

Nice spotty lacing is left on the glass. Nose is of citrusy hops with caramalized malts. Taste is fruity up front with the citrus hops adding to it, middle in finish is malts, toasted malts in the middle to balance out the hops and the finish is sweet malts caramel with a touch of toffee.

8.3,20232,2372,Terrapin Big Hoppy Monster,American Amber / Red Ale,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Mavajo,4.5," Very interesting and dynamic beer. Poured a dark brown color with hues of red when held to the light. Despite the classification, there's very little amber here to speak of. Very average head that dwindled pretty quickly. Nose was very peachy and hoppy. I'm thinking the ""peach"" sensation may have been a combination of other smells that my palate couldn't distinguish, but that's the best description I can come up with. 		Taste reflected the same quality noticed during the smell. That said, the experience of this beer can change dramatically depending on how you drink it. If you let it linger on the tip of your tongue and then swallow it quickly, only grazing the back of it as it goes down, this is a fairly malty, sweet beer with a mild hoppy bitterness. However, if you let this sweep along the sides of your tongue, or even let it linger there, this becomes a significantly more hoppy and bitter experience, with the malt being pushed back a bit more. I found it to be a very interesting brew.		Mouthfeel is fairly medium. There's a bit of a silkiness going on here. Quite drinkable, especially if you enjoy hops.",2009-10-07 01:33:56
7.5,3842,207,Trappistes Rochefort 6,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,ClockworkOrange,4.5," A capped 11.2 ounce bottle poured into my basic tulip glass. Appears a cloudy chestnut color with about an inch of dense light rust colored foam. Nice retention. Flavors and aromas consist of prunes, raisins, molasses, bruised apples, sweet malts, spices, yeast. Nearly full bodied for the style with ample carbonation. Little to no alcohol heat. Tasty and complex.",2009-10-07 01:36:51
8.33,47782,2391,Cascade The Vine,American Wild Ale,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,nickd717,4.0," Bottle from City Beer in SF.		A - Pours hazy golden in color with a fluffy white head.		S - Aroma is very nice, fairly tart and lactic with white white, oak, and fruity esters.		T - Lactic tartness, white grapes, oak, sour green apple, and citrus. Alcohol noticeable but not too much for the ABV.		M - Palate nice and fairly acidic with medium body and somewhat high carbonation.		D - Above average. This beer is pretty good overall, but not the best from Cascade. A bit expensive at $20+.",2009-10-07 01:38:35
10.6,47140,119,Otter Creek Russian Imperial Stout,Russian Imperial Stout,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,kirok1999,4.0," Pours a deep black, legs on the glass and almost no head or fizz. 	Smells sweet and chocolatey. Some dark fruit and citrus hops. Mild coffee.	Taste has much more coffee than the smell. Almost dominates the chocolate notes. Dark fruit in the finish leaves the mouth sticky and a bit dry.	Rich and creamy and it's a really nice sipper.",2009-10-07 01:39:02
5.6,12694,262,He'Brew Messiah Bold,American Brown Ale,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,PriorateOden,3.0," Pours nicely with about a good inch of head. I loved the high level of carbonation... plenty of bubbles. It looks great, and I had high, high expectations. the bottle, by the way, is so cool, and the Shmaltz marketing machine is in fine form. Sadly, that's where the extraordinary characteristics end. The smell wasn't impressive, and while the taste and drinkability are fine, they aren't equal to the marketing and label. Easy to finish to that last drop, but this isn't going to have me telling Pharaoh to stick it up his pyramid. Nope, this was pretty good, but I'm headed back for more gentile brews. Shalom.",2009-10-07 01:39:02
8.72,34877,30,Collaboration Not Litigation Ale,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,natelocc787,3.0," This beer had a decent amount of sediment which hurt my opinion of it but I am leaving an unbiased review of the beer as if it had none. Just thought potential buyers would like to know. Average IMO. The Avery Salvation was much better. Off flavor somewhere in this bottle. Dark raisin and prune juice. Red apple and fig jam. Silky,foamy and dry texture. Wasn't bad but I won't buy it again.",2009-10-07 01:39:10
7.0,52535,2372,Terrapin Midnight Project Depth Charge Espresso Milk Stout,Milk / Sweet Stout,4.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,zplug123,4.0," Poured from a bomber into a 16 oz glass:		A: Black with dark brown tints at the edges. Creamy head with minimal retention		S: The espresso is noticeable, along with a sweet tinge. Almost like an iced espresso drink kind of smell		T: Coffee flavor is up front with small amount of sweetness balanced by malt with slight bitterness at the end.		M: Very smooth for such a dark beer, full bodied with little carbonation		D: A prime example of a coffee stout, not much of a fan usually but I could see myself drinking quite a few more of this.",2009-10-07 01:42:44
10.0,50331,158,15th Anniversary Wood Aged,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,prototypic,3.5," 15th Anniversary is a darker shade of brown. It's mostly clear and penetrating light reveals some nice orange highlights. Sitting atop is a vanilla colored that reaches over two and a half fingers. It was slow to recede and left plenty of thick, sticky chunks of lace clinging to the glass. Not bad at all.		The nose is alright. It's interesting, but a little disappointing. The strongest scents rolling out of the glass are oak and vanilla. They smell nice and I don't have a problem with them. The interesting thing is that there's very little going on in terms of hops. There's a light floral hop scent, but that's about it. Disappointing for a DIPA. Caramel malts seem to hold down the base well, but don't smell overly strong. They do add a nice sweet scent to the mix. Alcohol is mildly noticeable. I wouldn't have guessed it's 10%. It's not bad. It's just not very DIPA-ish.		The flavor continues the theme. Initially, it's a little sweet and malty. Caramel malt gives a nice strong backbone. It's actually a nice malt flavor. Not overly strong. Vanilla and oak are very strong in flavor. I like the flavor combo, but it's not really working well here. There's not enough hop flavor that stands out. There are some floral notes and it has some ancillary bitterness, but that's the only evidence of hops present. Disappointing. Alcohol is more prominent, but it's not quite hot. For a 10% beer, it's blended pretty well. No complaints there. This is an intriguing beer. Overall, it's not bad. It really is alright. But, it's not very good for a DIPA.		15th Anniversary has a medium body that's nice and smooth. Carbonation is on the low side and gives it an overall smooth feel. Drinkability, however, is above average. The flavor's okay, but doesn't excel for a DIPA. I'm good with a bomber.		Great Divide's a brewery that's really impressed me lately. I like a lot of their recent trailblazing releases. This one, however, is the weakest of the bunch. The lack of hops doesn't work well given the style. If the vanilla and oak flavors were a little more in the background and more hops were added, it would be better. Perhaps those flavors just mask the hops. In any event, it's hop deficient. I still love Great Divide and hope they continue doing exactly what they've been for many years to come. This release is just a little off the beaten path and doesn't live up the lofty standards they've set for themselves. It's certainly worth a try, but that's about it. Happy 15th!",2009-10-07 01:49:08
10.0,53171,612,Collaborative Evil 2009,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,paco1029384756,4.0," Pours an amber color with one and a half fingers of creamy white head.		Scent of orange peel, apples, spices, rich sugars, and a hint of alcohol. Seems like a bit of a hodgepodge of Belgian Strong Pale Ale and a Tripel.		Taste of clove, cherries, spices, dry fresh oak, caramel, and a hint of chalky malts. A solid beer which I think will definitely get better with some age on it.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but the carbonation is a bit weak.",2009-10-07 01:50:01
5.5,19976,9790,Duck-Rabbit Amber Ale,American Amber / Red Ale,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,prototypic,3.5," Amber Ale isn't exactly amber. It is a darker shade of copper. It's very clear and light reveals some nice orange and scarlet undertones. A vanilla colored head tops it off. It's a rather modest one finger in depth. Retention was on the short side and lacing was very sparse. 		The nose is a little weak, but it's still above average. It's a little sweet smelling. Caramel malt seems to be the strongest scent here. It's followed closely a yeasty, almost biscuit-like scent. There's a light whiff of some hops, but not much. I had really hoped for more. A really good amber needs a good bit of hops. This doesn't smell like it stacks up in that department. Toward the end, toasted malts and a light nutty scent emerge. Alcohol is not noted at all. It's alright, but could be better.		The flavor profile is alright, but suffers the same fate. It has a nice, somewhat sweet malty base. Toasted malts are also noted. Hops are more prominent here and provide a nice bitter kick. But, there's not a lot of great hop flavor. It's not enough to carry the day here. What little there is tastes mostly earthy and floral. I don't have a problem with that, I'd just like more. It's skewed a little too far in the malt direction for my preference. Alcohol is blended well and goes unnoticed. It finishes sweet and a little bitter.		Amber Ale has a light body is relatively smooth given its consistency. Carbonation seems to be just about right. It really has a nice feel for a light bodied beer. Drinkability is above average. Yeah, it goes down easy, but there's not enough flavor here to really exceed. A single 12 ounce is plenty for me.		My short, limited experience with Duck Rabbit has been good. This one's alright, but isn't an award winner. It's a little too tame for an Amber Ale. The malt profile is good and probably has enough bitterness to get by, but there's not enough hop flavor. It needs more. Make that one small change and I expect it'd improve dramatically. It's an alright beer and is worth a try. But, I wouldn't seek it out.",2009-10-07 01:50:18
7.2,39296,14400,Oatis,Oatmeal Stout,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,GJ40,4.0," Sampled from a 22oz bottle purchased at Pike Street Beer & Wine in Seattle. No date on the bottle.		Deep, dark and black with no light coming through and a small brown head. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, brown sugar and molasses. Flavor is rich and syrupy with chocolate, coffee, molasses, some hop flavor and a touch of maple syrup. There's very little bitterness and a moderate sweetness. The 7.2% alcohol is well hidden. The consistency is syrupy and the carbonation is low. It's almost worthy of a spoon.		This is a nice stout with lots of substance and serious drinkability. It's definitely not just for breakfast.",2009-10-07 01:50:50
5.4,61547,23058,Hoppy Dog,American Pale Ale (APA),4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,ClockworkOrange,2.0," A very nice looking cobalt blue 1L swing top. Poured into my nonic pint glass. Appears a hazed pale yellow color with about a finger of fluffy bone white head. So far, so good. I spoke too soon. Nose and flavor are of wild skunk cabbage, caramel, lemon, toasted bread, more skunk cabbage, vegetal, not too pleasant. Decent carbonation levels with a light body. More thought should have been put into what is in the bottle rather than the bottle itself. Steer clear.",2009-10-07 01:52:06
7.0,782,113,Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout,Russian Imperial Stout,5.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,SamN,3.0," Bomber purchased from Campus West Liquors and poured in my classic Cutthroat Porter tumbler.		A- Pours nearly total black, but glows red against light. Huge tan head, beautiful foam that flows out and down the glass.		S- Soy sauce, vinegar and bourbon in the nose.		T- Lighter tasting than I remember. Light on malt and heavy grains, floral and lightly hoppy, slight alcohol finish. Nothing very ""imperial"" about this imperial stout at all. Not bad tasting, just lacks what I love about stouts.		M- Thinner than most, medium body with little carbonation.		D- Very good. Being a lighter-than-most stout lends itself to more drinkability, so higher marks for sippability.",2009-10-07 01:54:05
7.5,52128,694,TrÃ¶egs Java Head Stout,Oatmeal Stout,5.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,boralyl,3.5," A - Pours 1 inch of mocha colored head that has a nice retention and laces the inside of the glass very well. The beer is a very deep brown, nearly black.		S - Roasted malts, coffee, and a bit of hops make up the nose. I'm a little disappointed because Scratch #15 and #19 (which I thought this is based off of, apparently not) had much more pungent noses, however I had those on tap and from a growler, rather than bottled.		M - Medium in body, maybe a tad bit too thin on the mouth feel. It feels a little too watery. Minimal carbonation.		T - It tastes very similar to the labels description. There are roasted malts and coffee flavors initially followed by a hint of citrus hops. It's finished with some bitter chocolate and hops.		This isn't a bad brew, but nowhere near as good as I had anticipated after having Scratch #15 and #19.",2009-10-07 01:56:41
10.2,48411,18134,Belgian Tripel,Tripel,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,MrHungryMonkey,3.5," Nose is fruity and malty with a soft Belgian yeastiness. Smells pretty good. 		Pours clear gold, moderate head. Looks good.		Moderately sweet with crisp sugar/honey-attenuated edge of alcohol. Mildly fruity, tropical, floral. Hints of spices - lemon peel, coriander, ginger/mint. Otherwise moderately malty - bready with some toast. Finishes softly dry with a hint of alcohol. Tastes pretty good. Feels pretty good. Pretty good drinkability.",2009-10-07 01:56:53
5.7,46767,8,Drifter Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,thespaceman,4.0," Had on tap at Smokin' With Chris in Southington		Poured into a Drifter pint glass:		Pours a beautiful, deep copper in color. Lots of head on this bad boy, with very soapy, sticky lacing on the glass. Smell is of really light fruit aromas, not your big IPA or APA malt forward aromas and hoppy overtones, but a very subtle showing of some passionfruit. Taste is on point, I get almost a peach-like tinge that overtakes the palate, followed by a decent amount of some citrus from the hops. Malt backbone is light enough to let the hops dance around on the tongue. Great mouthfeel on this, a bit slick and wet, yet holds up on the tongue smoothly with decent carbonation and bitterness. Overall, a valiant effort from the Widmer Brothers and one of the better APA's out there. Even my girlfriend wanted more Drfiter. Recommended!",2009-10-07 01:57:03
10.0,36728,18149,10 Commandments,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,ClockworkOrange,4.0," This bottle has been in the cellar for at least a year. A corked 750ml bottle poured into my Duvel tulip glass. The ale appears the color of murky fresh brewed iced tea with about two fingers of creamy ecru colored foam. The head lingers until the glass is nearly empty. Nose and flavors consist of dark brown sugar, molasses, raisins, prunes, dates, rich caramel, sweet biscuits, yeast, figs, dark cherry skins. Between medium and full bodied for the style with adequate carbonation levels. Quite tasty.",2009-10-07 01:57:56
6.5,184,141,Smuttynose Old Brown Dog Ale,American Brown Ale,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,Jayli,4.0," consumed 10/2/09	This beer poured a nice clear, ruby tinged brown with no real head to speak of. A small film sits on top of this beer with not much lacing to speak of. Nose is of caramel and toffee malts, and a hint of hazelnut. Taste is starts with some sweet brown sugar, lending in to the caramel malts mixed with a hint of hop bitterness and a touch of toffee malts in the finish. Lighter body, high carbonation, goes does easily clean feel with a dry finish to it. Some what sweet aftertaste to it. This is a nice brown ale that I could sit with for a bit, but the sweetness in the aftertaste may get to me after a bit.",2009-10-07 01:58:20

Soft pour, yields a very nice 3/4 inch of off white head. Head exhibits fantastic staying power. Color is a very cloudy amber yellow. 		Nose- Some light European hop. Slightly astringent. Green apple.		Pallate- Very nice. Lemon zest, some peppery spice. Green apple tartness. Very crisp and refreshing, creamy. Lemon zest becomes more prevalent as it warms. Strong yeast presence. Very Good.		Mouthfeel- Very active, tart and a bit dry.		Drinkability- Very Good. Its been to long since my last visit to the style.",2009-10-07 01:58:45
9.8,21166,156,Imperial Nut Brown Ale,American Brown Ale,3.5,4.0,2.5,3.5,natelocc787,4.0," This beer contained sediment. Maple and brown sugar were very prominent as is the dark sugary malt. This beer had a distinct cherry flavor in the middle albeit a very dark cherry liqueur character. Nutty, toffee too. Tasted like a very high abv brown ale with cherry juice. Just not that drinkable or appealing to me. I would say I was surprised that it tasted so different than I would expect an Imperial Brown to taste. Was not impressed at all as some other reviewers were.",2009-10-07 02:02:23
5.9,52598,689,Oak Aged Domaine DuPage,BiÃ¨re de Garde,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,Vonerichs,4.0," Pours an amber hue, more on the reddish side. 		The nose is all oak with hints of vanilla. There's a light fruit punch in the backround. 		The oak dominates and overpowers the other flavors, but there is some hint of red apples and fruit punch. Good taste, but the oak overshadows the rest. 		Mouthfeel is sweet and syrupy, slightly sticky on the toungue.		Good tasting beer, but the oak takes over and one is enough. I'd try it again, but nothing I'd ever consider sessioning.",2009-10-07 02:02:27
10.4,28578,3818,Jahva (Imperial Coffee Stout),American Double / Imperial Stout,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,ritzkiss,3.5," 22oz bottle from Bobsy a while ago, finally cracking it. Thanks man!		Pours a dark, almost black, hints of russet brown around the edges. Nice layer of mocha head that dies to an oily slick. 		Nose is full of coffee grounds, lots of sweetness, molasses, hints of chocolate.		This is a big brutish brew (as ST bombers tend to be) but I don't think it's as well integrated as some of the others are. Lots of brewed cold coffee, coffee grounds, thick syrupy sweet body, hints of dark fruits, brown sugar, caramel, light chocolate. Seems to me that the coffee stands on top of the sweetness rather than melding with it, leaving the sugary rush to dominate the back end of the brew. Hint of drying in the finish. Medium-full body.		Hard to call this drinkable I think at 11% and being the sugary, off kilter brew it is. Could drink this in small amounts but this bomber is going to last me a while.",2009-10-07 02:02:37
